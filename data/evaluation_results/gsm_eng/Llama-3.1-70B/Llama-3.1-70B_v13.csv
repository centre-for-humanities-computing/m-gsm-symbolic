Then he increases it to 7 eggs a day for 54 days for a total of 7*54 = <<7*54=378>>378 eggs
All total he will eat 330+378 = <<330+378=708>>708 eggs
There are 12 eggs in 1 dozen and he will eat 708 eggs which is 708/12 = 59 dozen eggs

During the next 54 days, she will need 54 * 7 = 378 <<54*7=378>> eggs.
She will need 330 + 278 = 608 <<330+378=608>> eggs altogether.
%%<T>The answer is 1 dozen of 12 eggs, so she will need 608 / 12 <<608/12=50>> dozens of eggs.

991,Comet Hale-Bopp orbits the sun every 60 years. Chris's grandfather saw the Comet when he was 26 years old. Chris saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his grandfather was when he saw the Comet. How old was Chris when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"Chris saw the Comet for the second time when he was 26 years * 3= <<26*3=78>>78 years old.
Comet Hale-Bopp can be seen every 60 years, so Chris saw the comet for the first time when he was 78 years - 60 years = <<78-60=18>>18 years old.
#### 18"," The comet was spotted in 1986 and will return in 2061, so it has passed in the range of 1935 to 2000.
If we combine all the expressions we get:
Chris'sGrandfatherAge + CometAge + (3 * Chris'sGrandfatherAge) + CometAge = 2 * ChrisAge
and in our example:
(26 + 60) + (26 * 3) + 60 = 2 * $$x$$

If Ellen is sure to get 100% of the geography questions, then this means she is sure of her 60 questions*100/100 = <<60*100/100=60>>60 points.
From the geometry and history questions, she is sure to get three fifths of it correctly so that is 49 questions*3/5 = <<49*3/5=29>>29 points.

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?","If Sophia can skip at one third the speed she can run, then she can run at 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is thrice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/3=2 miles per hour.
If two thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*2/3=<<6*2/3=4>>4 hours.
If one third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
