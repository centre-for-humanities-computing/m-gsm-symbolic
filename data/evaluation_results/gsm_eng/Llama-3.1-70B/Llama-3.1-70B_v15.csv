What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?","While Andrea is processing 59 orders in a day, Olivia processes 59 orders/day*5=<<59*5=295>>295 orders/day.
In a day, they process 295 orders/day + 59 orders/day = <<295+59=354>>354 orders together.
The total number of orders the two processes in a week is 354 orders/day * 7 days/week = <<354*7=2478>>2478 orders
#### 2478"," The meaning of ""exactly five times as"" means we have to multiply something with 5.
5 * 59 = <<5*59 = 295>> customers daily for Olivia.
Then Andrea + Olivia gives us daily total of 59 + 295 = <<59+295 = 354>> customers.
