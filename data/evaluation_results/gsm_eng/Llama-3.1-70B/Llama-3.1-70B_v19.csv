These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away performance. How many students are leaving early?","28% of the 92 student class are swimmers so that's 0.28*92 = <<0.28*92=25>>25 students
There are 92 students and 25 are swimmers so that leaves 92-25 = <<92-25=67>>67 students
42% of the remaining 67 students are part of robotics club members or debate team members so that's 0.42*67 = <<0.42*67=28>>28 students
25 students are swimmers and 28 are part of robotics club members/debate team members so 25+28 = <<25+28=53>>53 students will be leaving early
#### 53"," If 28% of the class are swimmers, there are 28 students because <<92*0.28=25.76>>28% of 92 is 25.76, but there cannot be a decimal point, so there are 28 students.
There are 64 remaining students because 92-28=<<92-28=64>>64
If 42% of those 64 students are in the debate club or on the robotics club####
