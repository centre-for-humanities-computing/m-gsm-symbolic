684,Lily and Abby have 133 minutes to walk to the mall together. It takes them 18 minutes to get to the corner where the school is. It takes them another 26 minutes to get to the cinema. How much longer do they have to get to mall without being late?,"Lily and Abby arrive at the school with 133 - 18 = <<133-18=115>>115 minutes left to reach the cinema.
They then arrive at the cinema and have 115 - 26 = <<115-26=89>>89 minutes left to get to mall without being late.
#### 89"," The corner is 18 minutes from the house, and the cinema is 26-18 = <<26-18=8>>8 minutes from there.
Adding 8 minutes to 18 gives 18+8=<<18+8=26>>26.
To get to the mall from the house will take almost twice that time, so it will take 26+26=<<26+26=52>>52 minutes.

If he makes 4 giant cubes, 8 medium cubes, and 15 small cubes, how many ozs of water does he have left?","The giant cubes used up 16 ozs of water because 4 times 4 equals <<4*4=16>>16.
The medium cubes used up 16 ozs of water because 8 times 2 equals <<8*2=16>>16.
The small cubes used up 3 ozs of water because 15 times 1/5 equals 3.
This means that Oliver has used up 35 ozs of water because 16 plus 16 plus 3 equals 35.

If there are 25 goats and 27 cows, how many pounds of grain does Carl need?","First figure out how much grain each cow needs: 10 pounds * 2 - 9 = <<10*2-9=11>>11 pounds/cow
Now figure out how much grain total the cows need: 11 pounds/cow * 27 cows = <<11*27=297>>297 pounds
Now figure out how much grain total the goats need: 10 pounds/goat * 25 goats = <<10*25=250>>250 pounds
