11,"Ava went to the cafe and bought various types of desserts. She bought 3 dozen donuts which cost $17 per dozen, 5 dozen tarts which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen mini cheesecakes for $116 per dozen. How much was the total cost?","The total charge for the donuts was 3*$17 = $<<3*17=51>>51.
The total charge for the tarts was 5*$77 = $<<5*77=385>>385.
The total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 3*$116 = $<<3*116=348>>348.
Therefore the total amount Ava paid for the desserts was $51 + $385 + $348 = $<<51+385+348=784>>784.

1247,"Bob has a bag of buttons with 38 inside. He tripped over a rock while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 12. When he went back home, he inspected the buttons further. Four of the ones he picked up weren't buttons, but actually coins so he got rid of them. How many buttons did Bob end up with?","Bob dropped his buttons and was left with 38*1/2=<<38*1/2=19>>19 buttons.
He searched and found some of his lost buttons, getting him back to 19+12=<<19+12=31>>31 buttons.
He went home and removed four coins, leaving him with 31-4=<<31-4=27>>27 buttons.
#### 27"," We know that half of 38 is 17+12 =<37 buttons from the bag>
