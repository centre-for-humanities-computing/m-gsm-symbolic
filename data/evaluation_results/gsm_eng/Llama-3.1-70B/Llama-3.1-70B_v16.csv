103,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 298 minutes to cover every 40 miles of the city. If the city is 60 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?","The city will be covered in 60/40 = <<60/40=1>>1 intervals of 298 minutes.
Thus, it will take 1 * 298 = <<1*298=298>>298 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.
#### 298"," Let m = miles and F = fogcovered miles
Let c = city and {m_{c}} = miles the city covers
Then, {m_{c}} = 40+40=<<40+40=80>>80 (from the ocean to the opposite side)
Let s = speed (ratio) of covering miles per time (minutes)
Let t =time (minutes)
Next, use a proportion to determine the ratio s of how
