On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 60-minute show. On Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 5-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 5-hour episodes. If he watched 26 hours of TV in all, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?","Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Monday.
After Saturday, he had 26 - 1 = <<26-1=25>>25 hours of TV left.
After Sunday, he had 25 - 1 = <<25-1=24>>24 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 24 - 5 - 0.5 = 18.5 hours of TV left.
After Wednesday, he had 18.5 - 15 = 3.5 hours of TV left.
Each 60-minute episode is 1 hour.
Thus, E = 3.5/1 = 3.5 episodes.
