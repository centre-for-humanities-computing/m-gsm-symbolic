Then multiply the amount one troll can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of trolls: 13 pounds/day/troll * 23 trolls = <<13*23=299>>299 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 299 pounds/day * 28 days = <<299*28=8372>>8372 pounds/day
#### 8372"," The trolls can each mine 5*1.3=<<5*1.3=6.5>>6.5 pounds of ore per day with a bronze pickaxe
So in a month they can mine 6.5*28=<<6.5*28=182>>182 pounds of ore per month.
So 23 of them can mine 182*23=<<182*23=4186>>4186 pounds of ore in a month

554,When the water is cold Ellen swims a mile in 19 minutes. When the water is warm Ellen swims a mile in 1 minutes more than thrice as long. How much longer does Ellen take to swim 7 miles on a hot day than a cold day?,"Cold water mile = <<19=19>>19 minutes
Warm water mile = 1+3*19=58 minutes
7 miles in cold water: 7(19)=<<7*19=133>>133 minutes
7 miles in warm water: 7(58)=<<7*58=406>>406 minutes
Ellen takes 406-133=<<406-133=273>>273 minutes longer
#### 273"," On a hot day she swam 4*19 = (<<4*19 =76>>76) minutes
On a cold day she swam 19*7 =<<19*7=133>>133 minutes
Her hot swimming time took 76-133=<<76-133=-57>>57 minutes less than on a cold day
She took <<-57/60=-0.9500000000000001>>-0.95 hours more
