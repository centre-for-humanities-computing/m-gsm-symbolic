The children find a total of 11 + 22 + 20 + 5 = <<11+22+20+5=58>>58 eggs.
The total number of hidden eggs still in the yard is 72 - 58 = <<72-58=14>>14 eggs.
#### 14"," Andrea finds 2 less than Jessica, so Andrea finds as many as Claire, so 11 eggs. So Joshua finds one quarter of that, which gives 2.75 eggs
If we add up all the eggs they found, we have:
11 + 2*11 + (2*11 - 2) + 2.75 = <<11 + 2*11 + (2*11 - 2) + 2.75=55.75>>55.75
6 dozen make <<6 dozen=72>>72 eggs,####

Together, Joshua and Lily can eat 3 + 9 = <<3+9=12>>12 pieces a day.
So, a pie will last for 12/12 = <<12/12=1>>1 days.
#### 1"," If Joshua can eat 3 pieces a day, Lily can eat 3*3 = <<3*3=9>>9
The bunch of two can finish 3+9 = <<3+9=12>>12 pieces a day (which is the whole pie)
So, the pie will last 1 day

If Jessica is sure to get 45% of the geography questions, and three quarters of the geometry and physics questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?","The geometry and physics questions comprises 100% - 20% = 80% of the quiz.
There are 30 questions*20/100 = <<30*20/100=6>>6 geography questions.
There are a total of 30 questions*80/100 = <<30*80/100=24>>24 geometry and physics questions.
If Jessica is sure to get 45% of the geography questions, then this means she is sure of her 6 questions*45/100 = <<6*45/100=2>>2 points.
From the geometry and physics questions, she is sure to get three quarters of it correctly so that is 24 questions*3/4 = <<24*3/4=18>>18 points.
Thus, she is sure of getting 2 points + 18 points = <<2+18=20>>20 points in her quiz.
