#### 60"," First find the weight of Oliver, the car and the equipment: 1750 pounds + 3*100 pounds = <<1750+3*100=2150>>2150 pounds
Then add the weight of the two colleagues: 2150 pounds + 2*85 pounds = <<2150+2*85=2255>>2255 pounds
Now, use 3% in decimal as a proportion and multiply 2255 pounds by 0.03: 2255*#### 0",1.4133723779814318,False
1277,"Jessica and Anna are currently 25 years apart in age. If Jessica, who is younger than Anna, is 51 years old, what's the average of their ages?","If Jessica is 51 years old, Anna is 51+25 = <<51+25=76>>76 years old.
The sum of their ages is 76+51 = <<76+51=127>>127 years
The average age of the two is 127/2 = <<127/2=63>>63 years
#### 63"," In order to find the average, we first need to find each age. We subtract 25 years from their current age to find Anna's current age 51 years - 25 years = 26 years
The average age is found by summing their ages and dividing by 2 51 years + 26 years / 2 = 77 years / 2 = <<77/2=38.5>>38.5

1026,One troll can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with basic shovel. He can mine twice as much with a silver pickaxe and 50% more with a bronze pickaxe than with a silver pickaxe. How many kgs of ore can 20 trolls with bronze pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?,"First find how much ore a troll can mine with an silver pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 kgs/day
Then multiply that amount by 150% to find how much a troll can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 kgs/day * 150% = <<10*150*.01=15>>15 kgs/day
Then multiply the amount one troll can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of trolls: 15 kgs/day/troll * 20 trolls = <<15*20=300>>300 kgs/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 300 kgs/day * 28 days = <<300*28=8400>>8400 kgs/day
#### 8400"," First, find daily mineral yield for each type of pickaxe then multiply by 20 (to find yield of 20 trolls), then multiply by 28 (to find yield after 1 month):
Troll with basic shovel: 5kg x 20 trolls = 100kg
Troll with silver pickaxe: 5kg x 2 = 10kg x 20 trolls = 200kg
Troll with bronze pickaxe: 10k#### 20",1.0557724939426407,False
1084,"If David and Michael have 940 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Michael getting 160 yards more than David, how much is left over for David?","Let x be the amount of fence David gets and y be the amount Michael gets. We know that y = x + 160, and y + x = 940.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+160=940
Subtracting the 160 from both sides, we get 2x=780
We divide each side by two, leaving x=390. This means David has 390 yards of fence left over.
#### 390"," 940 yards / 2 = <<940/2=470>>470 yards for one of them
Michael gets 160 + 470 = <<160+470=630>>630 yards
Therefor, the remaining amount of fence left over is 940 - 630 = <<940-630=310>>310 yards
