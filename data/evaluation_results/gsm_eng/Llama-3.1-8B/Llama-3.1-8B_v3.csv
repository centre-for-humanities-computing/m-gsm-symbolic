873,Claire has $56.10341968911918 and wants to buy 32 washers from a bin at the hardware store. Each washer costs $0.98. How much money does Claire have left after paying for the washers?,"Claire paid 32 * $0.98 = $<<32*0.98=31.36>>31.36 for the washers.
Claire has $56.10341968911918 - $31.36 = $24 left.
#### 24"," First find how many washers per dollars Claire has assuming she has no money left over after paying for the washers: 32 / 56.10341968911918 = <<32/56.10341968911918=0.5714672212704452>>0.5714672212704452
Then multiply this value by the per washer cost to find how much money Claire left behind: $0. #### 0",0.9241521710064262,False
480,"Alex has 3 tubes of orange paint and 19 tubes of yellow paint. Carl has one third as many tubes of orange paint as Alex, and three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Alex. How many tubes of paint does Carl have?","Carl has 3*1/3= <<3*1/3=1>>1 tubes of orange paint
Carl has 19*3=<<19*3=57>>57 tubes of yellow paint
Carl has a total of 1+57 =<<1+57=58>>58 tubes of paint
#### 58"," Alex has 3 + 19 = 22 tubes of paint
Total tubes of paint among the two = 2 * 22 = 44
Carl has 44/3 = 14.6667 yellow tubes of paint
Carl has 3 tubes of orange paint and 14.6666 yellow tubes of paint

39,"Olivia can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is two thirds as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 4 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking?","If Olivia can skip at two thirds the speed she can run, then she can run at 4*3/2=<<4*3/2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/2=3 miles per hour.
If half of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 4*1/2=<<4*1/2=2>>2 hours.
If half of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 2 hours at 3 miles per hour, or 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.
#### 18"," If she can skip 4 miles in an hour, she can run 8 miles in an hour because she can run twice as fast: 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8
Then multiply 8 by 2 thirds to find the rate she can walk: 2/3*8 = <<2/3*8=(2/3)*8=5.333333333333333>>5.333333333333333
She can walk 5,33 miles per hour because 5.33 is a rounded 5####
