Since 87.50% is not greater than 100%, Oliver is not more likely to roll a number#### 2",0.8951453280169517,False
800,Lucas scored 387 points in one game of basketball. Claire scored 38 points more than two thirds as many as Lucas. How many points did Lucas and Claire have in total?,"Lucas = <<387=387>>387 points
Claire = 2/3*387 + 38 = 296 points
387 + 296 = <<387+296=683>>683 points
Together, Lucas and Claire scored 683 points.
#### 683"," In order to solve a problem where two variables exist, one needs to setup two equations to solve for the two variables.
This problem has two variables: x and y
Claire scored y points which is 3x + 38 points more than two thirds of Lucas points
Now use substitution to solve the equations.

1223,"To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay €0.75 for each minute of your call. After 18 minutes, that price drops to €0.5 per minute. How much would a 85-minute call cost?","First 18 minutes would be a cost of 18 * 0.75 = €<<18*0.75=13>>13.
After that, there are 85 - 18 = <<85-18=67>>67 minutes of the call left.
And these 67 minutes cost 67 * 0.5 = €<<67*0.5=33>>33.
So in total, the 85-minute call would cost 13 + 33 = €46.
