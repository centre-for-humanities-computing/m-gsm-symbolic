410,"Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $39 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $5 per pound, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" She scooped up 4 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $4.0 and 6 magnets that were $2.25 each. How much money does Sally have left?","Sally is buying 1 pound for $5 and gets 1 pound 1/2 off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $5*1/2 = $2.5. The rest of 2 pound does not have discount and costs 2*$5 = $10, so total is $5+$5/2+$10=$35/2
6 magnets at $2.25 each is 6*2.25=$<<6*2.25=13.5>>13.5
When you add all her purchases, 35/2+$4+$13.5 = $<<35/2+4+13.5=35>>35
She had $39 and spent $35 so she had $39-$35 = $<<39-35=4>>4 left over
#### 4"," The cost of the pound of regular taffy = 4 pounds * $5/ pound = << 4*5=20 >> $20.
The cost of the pound of half-off taffy = €3/pound * 1 pound = €3.
The total cost of the taffy is €20 + €3 = €<<20+3=23>>23.
The cost of the mixed bag of shells = $4.00.
