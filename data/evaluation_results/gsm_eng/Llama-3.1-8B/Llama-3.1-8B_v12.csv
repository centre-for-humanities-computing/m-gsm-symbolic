After Amanda takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 26 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Amanda have to eat?","In the second 26 seconds of cooking, 2*60=<<2*60=120>>120 kernels pop.
In the third 26 seconds, 4*60=<<4*60=240>>240 kernels pop.
In the final 26 seconds, 240 / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 kernels pop.
Thus, Amanda has 60 + 120 + 240 + 120 + 30 = <<60+120+240+120+30=570>>570 pieces of popcorn to eat.
#### 570"," 60 pop in the first 26 seconds.
2*60 pop after 26 seconds.
4*60 pop after 26 seconds.
1/2*(4*60) pop after 26 seconds.
We add the total popping rate of these kernels.
60+2*(60)+4*(60)+1/2*(2*60) = <<60+120+240+60=480>>480
The number of kernels popping in the next 26 seconds was 120. The kernels pop#### 2400",0.9005007810192183,False
365,"There are 17 girls in the playground. If there are four times the number of boys in the playground, how many kids are in the playground?","There are 17 girls*4 boys/girl = <<17*4=68>>68 boys in the playground.
In total there are 17 girls + 68 boys = <<17+68=85>>85 kids in the playground
#### 85"," Let $x$ be the number of boys in the playground.
Then $4x$ is the number of girls in the playground.
However, there are only 17 girls in the playground. Hence, $4x = 17$
Thus, there are $4 \times 17 = 68$ boys in the playground.
Therefore, the total number of kids in the playground is $4x + 17 = 5x#### 68",1.401178078027442,False
