661,Oliver goes to the store to buy some tea. The normal brand of tea he buys costs €6 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 25% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses 1 kg of tea per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for €1. How much did everything cost?,"The tea he bought was 6*0.25=€<<6*0.25=1>>1 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys
So it cost 6+1=€<<6+1=7>>7 per kg
He goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kgs of tea a week
So he paid 7.5*7=€<<7.5*7=52>>52 on tea
That means his total bill was 52+1=€<<52+1=53>>53
#### 53"," A week's worth of tea costs €36-€6=<<36-6=30>>30 because Oliver needs 30 kg of tea and €6 per kg of normal tea.
The muffin he buys costs €1 so it costs him €37-€36=<<37-36=1>>1 to buy his favorite brand and the muffin.

473,Ethan saw a 150-foot shark with 3 12-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 12 inches/remora * 3 remoras = <<12*3=36>>36 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 36 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<36/12=3>>3 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 3 foot / 150 feet * 100% = 2%

#### 2"," One remora is 1/2 of the shark's rump. That's 150/2 = <<150/2=75>>75 inches long.
The three remoras together are 75+75+75 = <<75+75+75=225>>225 inches long, which is 225/150 = <<225/150=1.5>>1.5 of the shark's body length.

If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 5 fewer hours of contract work, losing £48/hour in missed income. The tax consultant charges £53. How much more money will she have if she hires the tax consultant?","First find the total lost revenue if Emily does her financial planning herself: £48/hour * 5 hours = £<<48*5=240>>240
Then subtract the tax consultant's charge to find how much money Emily saves: £240 - £53 = £<<240-53=187>>187
