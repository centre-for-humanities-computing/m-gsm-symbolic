103,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 277 minutes to cover every 63 miles of the city. If the city is 97 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?","The city will be covered in 97/63 = <<97/63=1>>1 intervals of 277 minutes.
Thus, it will take 1 * 277 = <<1*277=277>>277 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.
#### 277"," It takes 277 minutes to cover 63 miles, so these numbers are in the ratio of 277 to 63.
Because the fog needed to cover the city is 97 miles across, we need to find out what number needs to cover the distance between the number 277 and 97, that is a distance of 20 miles.
