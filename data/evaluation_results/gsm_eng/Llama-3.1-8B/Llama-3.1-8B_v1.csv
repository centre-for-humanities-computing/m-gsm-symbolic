728,"Lily has 55 light blue spools of thread, 50 dark blue spools of thread, 60 light red spools of thread, and 65 dark red spools of thread. What percent of her spools are blue?","First find the number of blue spools: 55 spools + 50 spools = <<55+50=105>>105 spools
Then find the total number of spools: 60 spools + 65 spools + 105 spools = <<60+65+105=230>>230 spools
Then divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 105 spools / 230 spools * 100% = 45%
#### 45"," Her total spools of thread is 55 + 50 + 60 + 65 = <<55+50+60+65=230>>230.
By looking at the percent circle model, we know that 100% spools divided equally among the blue and red would mean that the blue takes up 2/4th of the pie, or 50% of all spools. But we know that there are more dark blue spool#### 50",0.851224725949578,False
1264,"Matt is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 80 pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then two times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to three times the initial popping rate in the next 30 seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Matt takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Matt have to eat?","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 2*80=<<2*80=160>>160 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 3*80=<<3*80=240>>240 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 240 / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 kernels pop.
Thus, Matt has 80 + 160 + 240 + 120 + 30 = <<80+160+240+120+30=630>>630 pieces of popcorn to eat.

For the red balls, 9 balls * €10/ball = €<<9*10=90>>90.
For the pink balls, 30 balls * €5/ball = €<<30*5=150>>150.

Since the three types of balls are made of different materials, they are unlikely to be of the same colours. Thus out of the 59 balls, we can assume there is at least 30*4/5 = <<30*4/5=24>>24 pink balls, 30*1/5 = <<30*1/5=6>>6 reds#### 59",1.5060913260094821,False

The number that remained hidden was 130 - 42 = <<130-42=88>>88 balls
Since 6 balls were not found, this means the friends found 88 - 6 = 82 balls.
#### 82"," The Williams twins together found 21 + 21 = 42 balls.
All the balls except 6 were found.
