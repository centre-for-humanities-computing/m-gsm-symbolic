937,"Carl is feeding his livestock grain. Each goat needs 10 pounds, and each cow needs 9 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. If there are 25 goats and 27 cows, how many pounds of grain does Carl need?","First figure out how much grain each cow needs: 10 pounds * 2 - 9 = <<10*2-9=11>>11 pounds/cow
Now figure out how much grain total the cows need: 11 pounds/cow * 27 cows = <<11*27=297>>297 pounds
Now figure out how much grain total the goats need: 10 pounds/goat * 25 goats = <<10*25=250>>250 pounds
Now add the two amounts of grain to find the total: 297 pounds + 250 pounds = <<297+250=547>>547 pounds
#### 547"," Each goat needs a total of 10 pounds; each cow needs $9 + 2 * 10 = 29$ pounds.
Multiply 29 by the number of cows, 27, to get how many pounds of grain is needed for all the cows
Multiply 10 by the number of goats, 25, to get how many pounds of grain is needed for all the goats

434,The vending machines sell pretzels for 70 cents and gum for 75 cents. Chris spent $10 and got 7 bags of pretzels and had 6% of his money left in change. How many gum did he buy?,"Chris got $0.6 in change because $10*6/100 = <<10*6/100=0.6>>0.6
Chris spent $9.4 because 10 - 0.6 = <<10-0.6=9.4>>9.4
Chris spent $4.9 on pretzels because 7*0.7 = <<7*0.7=4.9>>4.9
Chris spent 4.5 on gum because 9.4 - 4.9 = <<9.4-4.9=4.5>>4.5
Chris bought 6 gum because 4.5 / 0.75 = <<6=6>>6
#### 6"," When Chris spends 7 pretzels, he spends 7*40 = <<7*40=280>>280 cents.
With 20% of the money, after spending 7 pretzels, he has 0.2*100-0.2*280 = <<0.3*100-0.3*280=116>>116 cents.
For 2 pretzels he got 36 cents, so with 42 cents he can buy 42/36=<<42/36=1.1>>1.1 pretzel.

458,"Sarah's dog has 5 puppies, 8 of which have spots. Madison's dog has 9 puppies, 6 of which have spots. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?","First find the total number of puppies: 5 puppies + 9 puppies = <<5+9=14>>14 puppies
Then find the total number of puppies with spots: 8 puppies + 6 puppies = <<8+6=14>>14 puppies
Then divide the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of puppies with spots: 14 puppies / 14 puppies * 100% = 100%
#### 100"," There is a total of 5 + 9 = <<5+9=14>>14 puppies.
Their combined total of spots is 8 + 6 = <<8+6=14>>14.
Thus, the percentage is 14 / 14 = <<14/14=1>>100%.
