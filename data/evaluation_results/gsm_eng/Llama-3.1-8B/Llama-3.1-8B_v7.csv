1189,"Isabella sliced a whole mango into 16 pieces. She ate 2 slices, her sister ate 2 more than her, and her cousin ate 4 more than her sister. How many slices of mango did they all eat?","Her sister ate 2 + 2 = <<2+2=4>>4 slices.
Her cousin ate 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8 slices.
They ate a total of 2 + 4 + 8 = <<2+4+8=14>>14 slices.
#### 14"," If Isabella ate 2 slices, her sister will eat 2 more than her so she will eat 4 slices. Her cousin will eat 4 more than her sister so she will eat 8 slices.
22 + 4 + 8 = <<2+4+8=14>>14and not118711 because Isabella’s sister & cousin ate more than half the 16 slices so you need to count slices until#### 1141114",0.7982149550225586,False
99,"Jessica is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 26 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 10 potted plants on each of the 59 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 3 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Jessica remain with?","Two days ago, before receiving the plants, Jessica had 10*59 = <<10*59=590>>590 potted plants
After receiving an additional 26 plants, she therefore had a total of 590 + 26 = <<590+26=616>>616 potted plants
Tomorrow, Jessicas plant giveaway will be 59*3 = <<59*3=177>>177 potted plants.
She will therefore remain with 616 - 177 = <<616-177=439>>439 potted plants.
#### 439"," She will give 3*59=<<3*59=177>>177 potted plants to her friends and family.
So she will have 10+177-26=<<10+177-26=161>>161 potted plants remaining.
She will have 161 leftover.
