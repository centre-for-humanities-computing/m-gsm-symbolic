11,"Claire went to the bakery and bought various types of baked goods. She bought 8 dozen eclairs which cost $12 per dozen, 10 dozen tarts which cost $86 per dozen, and 9 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost?","The total charge for the eclairs was 8*$12 = $<<8*12=96>>96.
The total charge for the tarts was 10*$86 = $<<10*86=860>>860.
The total charge for the brownies was 9*$118 = $<<9*118=1062>>1062.
Therefore the total amount Claire paid for the baked goods was $96 + $860 + $1062 = $<<96+860+1062=2018>>2018.
#### 2018"," It is easier to deal with smaller multiples of dozen rather than trying to calculate huge numbers. If you have 8 dozen eclairs,
it is easier to do 8 dozen*12 = <<8*12=96>>96 rather than 96 donations per dozen. 96 ec lairs cost 8 dozen*10 = <<8*10=80>>80 rather than 80 donations per dozen.

So he drank 90*2=<<90*2=180>>180 calories of sparkling water
#### 180"," 15 mL * 6 = 90 calories. If he drinks 90 calories of regular water then he drinks double the calories in regular water. A cup has the same density as regular water. Double the caloried of regular water then he consumes 18 calories.

184,Joe is rolling a d12 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 11 numbers greater than 1 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 11/12=91%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 91% - 25% = 66%.
#### 66"," To roll a number greater than 1 means to roll any number from 2 to 12.
The chance of rolling a number greater than 1 on a d12 is 12/12, or 100%.
The chance of rolling two odd numbers in a row on the d12 die is:
That is, there is 1 chance out of 2 of rolling odd first.

William spent £9.1 because 10 - 0.9 = <<10-0.9=9.1>>9.1
William spent £3.5 on pretzels because 7*0.5 = <<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5
William spent 5.6 on cookies because 9.1 - 3.5 = <<9.1-3.5=5.6>>5.6
William bought 8 cookies because 5.6 / 0.7 = <<8=8>>8
