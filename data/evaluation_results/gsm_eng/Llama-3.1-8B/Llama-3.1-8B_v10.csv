Prince Lucas slew 2 * 33.xxx therefore 66.665
Total is 150 + 33 + 66.64 which is 249.64

M = 501.46 x 1/3 or 166.xxx and Prince Matt slew 1/4 as #### 41",1.4008963470114395,False
43,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 300 calories per serving. If a 300 grams bag has 5 servings, how many gramss can you eat if your daily calorie target is 1900 and you have already consumed 775 calories?","If the total calorie target is 1900 and I have consumed 775 calories then I have 1900-775 = <<1900-775=1125>>1125 calories left to eat
If each serving of cookies has 300 calories and I only have 1125 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 1125/300 of a serving = 15/4 of a serving
We also know that a 300 grams bag of cookies has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300 grams/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 gramss
If I can only eat 15/4 of a serving, then I can eat only 60 grams * 15/4 = 225 gramss
#### 225"," A serving is 300 calories. There are 300*5=<<300*5=1500>>1500 calories in 5 servings. The 300g bag has 300*300=<<300*300=90000>>90000 parts. You therefore can eat 90000/1500=<<90000/1500=60>>60 grams from the 300g bag to meet the daily calorie target.

800,Lily scored 408 points in one game of bowling. Eric scored 43 points more than one quarter as many as Lily. How many points did Lily and Eric have in total?,"Lily = <<408=408>>408 points
Eric = 1/4*408 + 43 = 145 points
408 + 145 = <<408+145=553>>553 points
Together, Lily and Eric scored 553 points.
#### 553"," If x is the number of points, and Lily scored x+43, then x=(1/4)(x+43)
Cross multiplying to get 4x=x+43
Subtracting both sides leaves 3x=43
Dividing both sides by three leaves x=43/3
Substituting in the solution for x out of the original equation x+43, we have (43/3) + 43, which is equal to 86 1/3.####

The total charge for the tarts was 5*$77 = $<<5*77=385>>385.
The total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 3*$116 = $<<3*116=348>>348.
Therefore the total amount Ava paid for the desserts was $51 + $385 + $348 = $<<51+385+348=784>>784.
