473,Jessica saw a 180-foot dolphin with 8 54-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 54 inches/remora * 8 remoras = <<54*8=432>>432 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 432 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<432/12=36>>36 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 36 foot / 180 feet * 100% = 20%

#### 20"," The remoras are just as long as the dolphin's body so 8 * 54 = 416 so the total length of the dolphin's body is 416*8 = 3432.

#### 25"," the total number of books is 17
the number of books my friend has is (17 - 9)
= (17 - 9) * 10 = (17 - 9)* 1 = (17 -9) * 1.5
therefore the total is 17*1.5
= (17*1.5)
= 26.5
so i = (17 - 9) * 1.5+ 26.5
= (17 - 9) * 1.5 + 26.5
= (17-9) * 1
= 17 * 1.5 = (17 * 1) 1.5
