473,Jessica saw a 180-foot dolphin with 8 54-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 54 inches/remora * 8 remoras = <<54*8=432>>432 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 432 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<432/12=36>>36 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 36 foot / 180 feet * 100% = 20%

#### 20"," The remoras are just as long as the dolphin's body so 8 * 54 = 416 so the total length of the dolphin's body is 416*8 = 3432.

After that, there are 55 - 26 = <<55-26=29>>29 minutes of the call left.
