1088,There are 5 periods in the day for a normal student but Joe has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/4 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 classes a day
