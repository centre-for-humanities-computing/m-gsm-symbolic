873,Chris has €80.5517098445596 and wants to buy 15 washers from a bin at the hardware store. Each washer costs €0.98. How much money does Chris have left after paying for the washers?,"Chris paid 15 * €0.98 = €<<15*0.98=14.7>>14.7 for the washers.
Chris has €80.5517098445596 - €14.7 = €65 left.
#### 65"," Chris has €80.5517098445596.

He buys 15 washers for €0.98 = €15.06 which are €80.5517098445596.

He has €80.5517098445596 - €15.06 = €69.496445547324
Which is €79.74631441258
Chris has €69.496445547324 so he has €10.049645547324 left to pay for the washers.

Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 120 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<120/12=10>>10 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 10 foot / 200 feet * 100% = 5%
