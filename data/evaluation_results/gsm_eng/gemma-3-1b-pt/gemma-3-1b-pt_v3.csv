788,"Alex is raising money for a science fair. He has applied for help from the community center, which has decided to cover one fifth of the cost of the science fair. How much money is Alex missing if he has $130 and the science fair costs $880?","Alex's community center has decided to pay 880*1/5=$<<880*1/5=176>>176 for his science fair.
In total Alex has covered 176 + 130 = $<<176+130=306>>306 for his science fair
Therefore, Alex needs 880 - 306 = $<<880-306=574>>574 more for the science fair.
#### 574"," The community center covers 50% of the cost so it is 50% of just the $130.
The science fair is 880 - 130 = 740.
The center covers 50% of 740.
So the community center covers $400 of the cost of the science fair, leaving Alex with $340.

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+150=280
Subtracting the 150 from both sides, we get 2x=130

If she can skip at 4 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking?","If Olivia can skip at two thirds the speed she can run, then she can run at 4*3/2=<<4*3/2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/2=3 miles per hour.
If half of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 4*1/2=<<4*1/2=2>>2 hours.
If half of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours.
