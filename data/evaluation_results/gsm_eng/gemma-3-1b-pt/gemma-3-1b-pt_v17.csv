How much more is the total price of the townhouse than Dr. Patel's budget?","The brokerage fee is $310,000*5/100 = $<<310,000*5/100=15,500>>15,500.
The transfer fee is $310,000*11/100 = $<<310,000*11/100=34,100>>34,100.
The total price of the townhouse is $310,000 + $15,500 + $34,100 = $359,600.
So, it is $359,600 - $320,000 = $<<359,600-320,000=39,600>>39,600 more than Dr. Patel's budget.

473,Oliver saw a 330-foot shark with 9 44-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 44 inches/remora * 9 remoras = <<44*9=396>>396 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 396 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<396/12=33>>33 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 33 foot / 330 feet * 100% = 10%
