Find the combined total of the number of bananas and corns Joe has in the house?","Before buying any banana and corn, Joe had thrice as many bananas as corns, which is 84 corns*3 banana/corn = <<84*3=252>>252 bananas
The total number of bananas and corns that Joe had before is 252 bananas + 84 corns = <<252+84=336>>336 items
When he bought 19 fewer bananas than corns, he bought 35 bananas - 19 bananas = <<35-19=16>>16 bananas
In total, he bought 16 bananas + 35 corns = <<16+35=51>>51 items
After the purchases, Joe has 336 items + 51 items = <<336+51=387>>387 total bananas and corns combined.
#### 387"," The total amount of bananas and corns Joe has in the house is: 84+35=/<84+35=119>>119 corns.
