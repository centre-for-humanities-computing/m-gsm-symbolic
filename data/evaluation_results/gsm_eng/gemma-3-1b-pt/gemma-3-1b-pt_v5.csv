If the force to move the car is 4% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the car?","His three colleagues weigh 50*3=<<50*3=150>>150 kilograms
So the total weight of the car and everything is 1000+325+150=<<1000+325+150=1475>>1475 kilograms
So he needs to generate 1475*0.04=<<1475*0.04=59>>59 kilograms

Therefore, he will need 70% * 1000 kg= 700 kg*kg to push the car.
Since he has 1000 kilograms in the car (1000*325 = 3.29*1000) and 50 kilograms in his car (50*325=1635), he needs 3.02*1000kg to move 1635+1.3*#### 00003299626962674563936489228969723288427146571272733875432326978365722160152682559287854483657221601526825576254608696412399106807254608696412399106807254608696412399106807254608696412399106807254608696412399106807254608696412399106807254608696412399106807254608696412399106807254608696412399106807254608696412399106807254608634859236983489698364002381423709",2.98313839698676,False

On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode and a 60-minute show. On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 1-hour episodes. If he watched 12 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?","Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Monday.

After Tuesday, he had 10 - 4 - 1 = 5 hours of TV left.

858,"A virus infects eight people. Every day, each infected person infects two others. How many people are infected after three days?","On the first day, the original eight people infect two people each, so 8*2 = <<8*2=16>>16 more people are infected.
There are 8+16 = <<8+16=24>>24 infected people after the first day.
On the second day, 24*2 = <<24*2=48>>48 more people are infected.
There are 24 + 48 = <<24+48=72>>72 infected people after the second day.
On the third day, 72*2 = 144 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 72 + 144 = 216 infected people after three days.

So, using math, we get ((640*90)/90) + (50*90)/90 = <18,000+50*90/90 = 92*90/90+50*90/90 = 18,000 - 90,000 + 50,000 = 9000/90####

Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<12/12=1>>1 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 20 feet * 100% = 5%

#### 5"," A dolphin is divided into 760 parts (Except the head). Suppose the remoras were all counted and then dissected if we had another mathematician available to count the remoras, we wouldn't get 20 feet, but 21.655 feet. 21.655 is the percentage of dolphin body length equal to the sum of the remoras.
