He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 12-lb bags. Oats are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys forty 75-lb packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys eighteen 45-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1950 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 lbs of hay.

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in eight hours if she spends three quarters of the time running and one quarter of the time walking?","If Jessica can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 12/2=6 miles per hour.
If one quarter of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 8*1/4=<<8*1/4=2>>2 hours.
If three quarters of the time is spent running, then she runs for 8-2=<<8-2=6>>6 hours.
Thus, she runs for 6 hours at 12 miles per hour, or 6*12=<<6*12=72>>72 miles.
