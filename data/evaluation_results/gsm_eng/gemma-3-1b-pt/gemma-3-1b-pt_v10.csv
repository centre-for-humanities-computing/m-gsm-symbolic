661,Carl goes to the store to buy some sugar. The normal brand of sugar he buys costs $7 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 10% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses 1 kg of sugar per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for $5. How much did everything cost?,"The sugar he bought was 7*0.1=$<<7*0.1=0>>0 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys
So it cost 7+0=$<<7+0=7>>7 per kg
He goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kgs of sugar a week
