We know that y = x + 190, and y + x = 240.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+190=240
Subtracting the 190 from both sides, we get 2x=50
We divide each side by two, leaving x=25. This means Isabella has 25 meters of fence left over.

Isabella gets 190-190=0 of fence.
Andrea gets 430-190=240 of fence.
Fin is divided between them, with a balance of 5 meter or more. In total there are 5+5=10 meters that are not on the fence.

473,Ethan saw a 150-foot shark with 3 12-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 12 inches/remora * 3 remoras = <<12*3=36>>36 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 36 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<36/12=3>>3 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 3 foot / 150 feet * 100% = 2%

#### 2"," The combined length of the remoras is 3 * 12 = 36 inches.
The combined length of the shark is 150 inches.
Therefore, 3*150=600 inches of the shark with remoras attached to it.

Be careful. When there's a double decimal point, it will be evaluated as a double number.
