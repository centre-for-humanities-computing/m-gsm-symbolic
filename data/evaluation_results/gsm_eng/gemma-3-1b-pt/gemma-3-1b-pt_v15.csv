1207,"Bob caught 5 steelheads last Wednesday, the first steelhead he caught weighs 71 kgs, the second steelhead he caught weighs 53 kgs, and the remaining steelhead he caught weighs 32 kgs. If a kg of steelhead costs £2.5, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?","Bob will earn 71*£2.5 = £<<71*2.5=177.5>>177.5 from the first steelhead.
He will earn 53*£2.5 = £<<53*2.5=132.5>>132.5 for the second steelhead.
The rest of the steelheads are 5-2 = <<5-2=3>>3. He will earn 32*£2.5 = £<<32*2.5=80>>80 per each of them. So he will earn 3 * 80 = <<3*80>>=240
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the steelheads is £177.5 + £132.5 + £240= £<<177.5+132.5+240=550>>550.
#### 550"," Bob caught 5 steelheads, which is a total of 5 * 2.5 = <<5 * 2.5=12.5>>12.5 kg.
After selling all the steelheads, the total is 12.5/5=<<12.5/5=2.5>>2.5 kg.
So they sell 12.5 kg to the market and earn £12.5 <https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/how-much-money-fish-sell-in-the-catch-market/<<https####

103,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 277 minutes to cover every 63 miles of the city. If the city is 97 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?","The city will be covered in 97/63 = <<97/63=1>>1 intervals of 277 minutes.
Thus, it will take 1 * 277 = <<1*277=277>>277 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.
#### 277"," Since the fog is covering 63 miles in each direction, each direction will be 63/7 = <<63/7=8.66>>8.66 miles covered in each direction.
So if 277 minutes are needed to cover 8.66 miles, the fog will cover the whole city in 277*8.66 = <<277*8.66=>>2278.66 minutes.
