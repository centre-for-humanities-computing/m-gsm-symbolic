She spent 220 minutes on sudoku puzzles and 247 minutes on word puzzles for a total of 220+247 = <<220+247=467>>467 minutes
#### 467"," Solver elapsed time = blocked time + recorded time
Blocker elapsed time = 10*22 - 13*19 = 84 minutes
Filtered elapsed time = solved time + unblocked time
Filtered elapsed time = 10*22 + 19*19 = 614 minutes

1264,"Amanda is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 60 pop in the first 26 seconds of cooking, then two times that amount in the next 26 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next 26 seconds, but in the final 26 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 26 seconds. After Amanda takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 26 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Amanda have to eat?","In the second 26 seconds of cooking, 2*60=<<2*60=120>>120 kernels pop.
In the third 26 seconds, 4*60=<<4*60=240>>240 kernels pop.
In the final 26 seconds, 240 / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 kernels pop.
Thus, Amanda has 60 + 120 + 240 + 120 + 30 = <<60+120+240+120+30=570>>570 pieces of popcorn to eat.
#### 570"," KERNEL SIZE = 0.2 = 2/20
Area = (2*2), or pi * 2^2

Let the Quantity of Popcorn to eat = Q
For the FIRST 26 seconds of cooking:
>> Area = (2*2)^0.2 = 0.2pi
= 0.2(3.1416 * 0.2) = 0.18 * 0.18 = 0.025

For the SECOND 26 seconds of cooking:
>> Area = (2*2)^0.3 = 0.3pi
= 0.3(3.1416 * 0.3) = 0.16 * 0.165####

365,"There are 17 girls in the playground. If there are four times the number of boys in the playground, how many kids are in the playground?","There are 17 girls*4 boys/girl = <<17*4=68>>68 boys in the playground.
In total there are 17 girls + 68 boys = <<17+68=85>>85 kids in the playground
#### 85"," Again, make the takeaway:
There are 17 girls in the playground.
Then find the number of boys: 4 *17 = 66 (boys)
Therefore there are 66 boys plus 17 = 83 kids in the playground. #### 83",0.20994304004125297,False
