520,"Amanda is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a sweater, vest, cardigan, mittens, and leg warmers for each of them. It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a sweater, 10 for a vest, 13 for a cardigan, 18 for a pair of mittens, and 16 for a pair of leg warmers. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?","A full outfit for each child will require 5 skeins per sweater + 10 skeins per vest + 13 skeins per cardigan + 18 skeins per pair of mittens + 16 skeins per pair of leg warmers = <<5+10+13+18+16=62>>62 skeins of wool.
So to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3*62 = <<3*62=186>>186 skeins of wool.
#### 186"," The number of shoes for each grandchild is:
3 trips = 1
12 grandchildren = 9
5 grandchildren = 3
Her purchases will come to
5 x 12 x 3 = <<5 x 12 x 3=60>>60 pairs of socks
5 x 9 x 3 = <<5 x 9 x 3=21>>21 pairs of shoes
So four pairs of socks and two pairs of shoes are needed.

473,Emma saw a 60-foot shark with 4 36-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 36 inches/remora * 4 remoras = <<36*4=144>>144 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 144 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<144/12=12>>12 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 12 foot / 60 feet * 100% = 20%

#### 20"," The length of the shark =<<60-foot + 4*36=120 feet>>120 feet.
Number of remoras on the shark = <<4*36+4*36=252>>252
So she must have remoras 252*1=576 inches long. Thus,
Length of shark = 60 - 252 =<<60-252=35>>359 and remoras length = 252*1=636 inches

If he works three days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 days.
Since he makes €120 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 12 * 120= €<<12*120=1440>>1440.
He also got a 162 * 4 = €<<162*4=648>>648 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of June.

B=162
