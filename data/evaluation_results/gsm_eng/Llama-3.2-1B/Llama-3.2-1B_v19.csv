These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away performance. How many students are leaving early?","28% of the 92 student class are swimmers so that's 0.28*92 = <<0.28*92=25>>25 students
There are 92 students and 25 are swimmers so that leaves 92-25 = <<92-25=67>>67 students
42% of the remaining 67 students are part of robotics club members or debate team members so that's 0.42*67 = <<0.42*67=28>>28 students
25 students are swimmers and 28 are part of robotics club members/debate team members so 25+28 = <<25+28=53>>53 students will be leaving early

How many like to dance if the number that like to read is twice the number that prefer playing cycling?","The number of students that like to read is twice as many as the number who like cycling, so 2 * 32 = <<2*32=64>>64
The number that like to dance is 119 total students - 14 that like to bake - 32 that like to play cycling - 64 that like to read = <<119-14-32-64=9>>9
#### 9"," If they like either cycling or dance, there are 32 students per group.
But if there dance, the 96 students dance, while the 23 students who play either dance or cycling instead like reading.
There are therefore 16 students who read exactly twice as many as the number of students who like cycling.

6 magnets at $2.25 each is 6*2.25=$<<6*2.25=13.5>>13.5
When you add all her purchases, 35/2+$4+$13.5 = $<<35/2+4+13.5=35>>35
