579,A student has 9 pencils. His brother has 4 fewer pencils than he has. How many pencils do they have together?,"His brother has 9 - 4 = <<9-4=5>>5 pencils.
Together, they have 9 + 5 = <<9+5=14>>14 pencils.
#### 14"," First, let's set up the number of pencils each parent has: Parent 1 = Parent 2
9 + 4 =<<9+4=13>>13
Next, we have to count the number of pencils in the combine (13): 8 + 4 =<<8+4=12>>12
