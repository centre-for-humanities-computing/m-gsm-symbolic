1084,"If Ethan and Kenneth have 340 meters of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Kenneth getting 20 meters more than Ethan, how much is left over for Ethan?","Let x be the amount of fence Ethan gets and y be the amount Kenneth gets. We know that y = x + 20, and y + x = 340.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+20=340
Subtracting the 20 from both sides, we get 2x=320
We divide each side by two, leaving x=160. This means Ethan has 160 meters of fence left over.
#### 160"," 340*20 = <<340*20=6910>>6910
Kent has 2899 meters left over because 6910 - 340 = 2899

She scooped up 3 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $3.0 and 8 magnets that were $0.0 each. How much money does Sally have left?","Sally is buying 1 pound for $5 and gets 1 pound 1/12 off. So 1/12 off of 1 pound is $5*1/12 = $0.4166666666666667. The rest of 1 pound does not have discount and costs 1*$5 = $5, so total is $5+$55/12+$5=$175/12
8 magnets at $0 each is 8*0=$<<8*0=0>>0
When you add all her purchases, 175/12+$3+$0 = $<<175/12+3+0=17>>17
She had $39 and spent $17 so she had $39-$17 = $<<39-17=22>>22 left over
