Then multiply that amount by 150% to find how much a troll can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 kgs/day * 150% = <<10*150*.01=15>>15 kgs/day
Then multiply the amount one troll can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of trolls: 15 kgs/day/troll * 20 trolls = <<15*20=300>>300 kgs/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 300 kgs/day * 28 days = <<300*28=8400>>8400 kgs/day
#### 8400"," The number of days it takes to mine one kgs of ore without pickaxes (28*20/5 = <<28*20/5=318>>318 days without pickaxes
Step 1: Mine 318 kgs / 50 or 318 kgs of ore with bronze pickaxes in 318 days.
Step 1 needed time * ore mined per day = <<318*318*50/50=9652>>9652 kgs of ore. Divide this kgs of o/#### 1",0.8009879819583148,False
1084,"If David and Michael have 940 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Michael getting 160 yards more than David, how much is left over for David?","Let x be the amount of fence David gets and y be the amount Michael gets. We know that y = x + 160, and y + x = 940.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+160=940
Subtracting the 160 from both sides, we get 2x=780
We divide each side by two, leaving x=390. This means David has 390 yards of fence left over.
#### 390"," David and Michael own 940 yards between them. When they share the remaining 192 yards, Michael gets 160 more yards than David. We don't know the exact total number of yards they own, but they are closest in number. We will consider David's yards to be slightly larger than Michael's yards, otherwise####
