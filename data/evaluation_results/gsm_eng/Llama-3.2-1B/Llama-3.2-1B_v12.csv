1264,"Amanda is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 60 pop in the first 26 seconds of cooking, then two times that amount in the next 26 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next 26 seconds, but in the final 26 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 26 seconds. After Amanda takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 26 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Amanda have to eat?","In the second 26 seconds of cooking, 2*60=<<2*60=120>>120 kernels pop.
In the third 26 seconds, 4*60=<<4*60=240>>240 kernels pop.
In the final 26 seconds, 240 / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 kernels pop.
Thus, Amanda has 60 + 120 + 240 + 120 + 30 = <<60+120+240+120+30=570>>570 pieces of popcorn to eat.
#### 570"," First get the pot of kernels' numbers of kernels in the past 26 seconds (first 26 seconds: 60; next 26 seconds: 4*60 = <<240>>240 kernels): <<2401>>2401 on the pot of kernels
Next, when the pot of kernels off the heat, Amanda must eat <<240/0.5=480>>480 kernels of popcorn.
