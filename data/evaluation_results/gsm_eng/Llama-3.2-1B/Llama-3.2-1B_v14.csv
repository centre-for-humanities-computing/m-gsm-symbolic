In total, he bought 24 kiwis + 46 cannolis = <<24+46=70>>70 items
After the purchases, Alex has 275 items + 70 items = <<275+70=345>>345 total kiwis and cannolis combined.
#### 345"," At Alex's house, there are four times as many kiwis since the two numbers are in the same ratio. He has 15 cannolis / 4 = <<15/4=3.75>>3.75 * 46 cannolis = <<46*3.75=1.81*46=8.62*46=396.2>>396.2 cannolis

304,"David works a 10-hour shift each day, seven days a week. He earns £25 per hour and gets a £253 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did David make in March if the company performed very well for the whole month?","In a day, David makes 10 * 25 = £<<10*25=250>>250
If he works seven days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 7*4=<<7*4=28>>28 days.
Since he makes £250 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 28 * 250= £<<28*250=7000>>7000.
He also got a 253 * 4 = £<<253*4=1012>>1012 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of March.
At the end of March, he earned 7000 + 1012 = £<<7000+1012=8012>>8012.
