If a kilogram of steelhead costs €1.75, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?","Ethan will earn 48*€1.75 = €<<48*1.75=84>>84 from the first steelhead.
He will earn 30*€1.75 = €<<30*1.75=52.5>>52.5 for the second steelhead.
The rest of the steelheads are 5-2 = <<5-2=3>>3. He will earn 30*€1.75 = €<<30*1.75=52.5>>52.5 per each of them. So he will earn 3 * 52.5 = <<3*52.5>>=157.5
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the steelheads is €84 + €52.5 + €157.5= €<<84+52.5+157.5=293>>294.

242,Oliver was a pen pal with 13 people. He stopped being penpals with 2 of them. They each send 3 letters a week that are 6 pages long. He responds in kind. He can write a page every 10 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week?,"Oliver is penpals with 13-2=<<13-2=11>>11 people
Thus he gets 11*3=<<11*3=33>>33 letters a week
So he writes 33*6=<<33*6=198>>198 pages a week
So he writes for 198*10=<<198*10=1980>>1980 minutes a week
So he writes 1980/60=<<1980/60=33>>33 hours a week

406,"At Joe's house, there are thrice as many bananas as corns. He has a total of 84 corns in his house. Joe bought 35 more corns at the store and 19 fewer bananas than the number of corns. Find the combined total of the number of bananas and corns Joe has in the house?","Before buying any banana and corn, Joe had thrice as many bananas as corns, which is 84 corns*3 banana/corn = <<84*3=252>>252 bananas
The total number of bananas and corns that Joe had before is 252 bananas + 84 corns = <<252+84=336>>336 items
When he bought 19 fewer bananas than corns, he bought 35 bananas - 19 bananas = <<35-19=16>>16 bananas
In total, he bought 16 bananas + 35 corns = <<16+35=51>>51 items
After the purchases, Joe has 336 items + 51 items = <<336+51=387>>387 total bananas and corns combined.
#### 387"," The number of corns Joe has is par2 of the number of bananas he has plus 19, so that number is (85-a)/(85+20)=(85-a)/(105)=72-a where a is the number of corns he initially had in the house so 33 more than the number of bananas he had plus 19 (in addition to 35 more that Joe bought).
