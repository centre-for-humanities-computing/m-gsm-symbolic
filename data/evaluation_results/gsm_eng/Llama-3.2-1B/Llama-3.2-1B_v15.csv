Case (1): Ethan is 46 years old when he saw the Comet.
Case (2): Ethan is 92 years old when he saw the Comet.
Case (3): Ethan is 108 years old when he saw the Comet.

1207,"Bob caught 5 steelheads last Wednesday, the first steelhead he caught weighs 71 kgs, the second steelhead he caught weighs 53 kgs, and the remaining steelhead he caught weighs 32 kgs. If a kg of steelhead costs £2.5, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?","Bob will earn 71*£2.5 = £<<71*2.5=177.5>>177.5 from the first steelhead.
He will earn 53*£2.5 = £<<53*2.5=132.5>>132.5 for the second steelhead.
The rest of the steelheads are 5-2 = <<5-2=3>>3. He will earn 32*£2.5 = £<<32*2.5=80>>80 per each of them. So he will earn 3 * 80 = <<3*80>>=240
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the steelheads is £177.5 + £132.5 + £240= £<<177.5+132.5+240=550>>550.
#### 550"," The sale of 5 steelheads is a total of 5 * 71 * 2.5 = <<5*71*2.5=20536>>20536
Bob earns 20536 pounds because £2.5 * x pounds = <<2.5*x*banks>>2.5*x*banks
And since Bob sells the steelheads, there should be 10 Kgs steelhead at the end, so the following should happen in Bob's pocket:

103,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 277 minutes to cover every 63 miles of the city. If the city is 97 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?","The city will be covered in 97/63 = <<97/63=1>>1 intervals of 277 minutes.
Thus, it will take 1 * 277 = <<1*277=277>>277 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.
#### 277"," The fog bank should take 977 minutes when it covers 63 miles to a distance of 97 miles from the ocean. We don't know the fog is reducing the distance three times:
And if I continue:
So the fog will take <<977*1/3=263>>263 minutes to cover the city.
