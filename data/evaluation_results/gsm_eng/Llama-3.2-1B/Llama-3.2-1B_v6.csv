What is the final value of all Jessica's shares?","First find the initial total value of Jessica's purchase: 14 shares * €23/share = €<<14*23=322>>322
Then find the amount of the first price increase: €322 * 0.95 = €<<322*0.95=305.9>>305
Add that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: €322 + €305.9 = €<<322+305.9=627.9>>627
Then multiply that amount by 5% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: €627.9 * 5% = €<<627.9*5*.01=31.395>>31
Then subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: €627 - €31 = €<<627-31=596>>596

184,Joe is rolling a d12 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 11 numbers greater than 1 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 11/12=91%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 91% - 25% = 66%.
#### 66"," To answer the question exactly, Joe has a 25% chance to roll a number greater than 1 number.
If he rolls one number only, he is 1 out of 4 chances to get a number greater than 1.
