661,Oliver goes to the store to buy some tea. The normal brand of tea he buys costs €6 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 25% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses 1 kg of tea per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for €1. How much did everything cost?,"The tea he bought was 6*0.25=€<<6*0.25=1>>1 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys
So it cost 6+1=€<<6+1=7>>7 per kg
He goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kgs of tea a week
So he paid 7.5*7=€<<7.5*7=52>>52 on tea
That means his total bill was 52+1=€<<52+1=53>>53
#### 53"," You buy the week's worth of tea by putting 7*6=<<7*6=42>>42 euro in you cart. This being 1kg of tea : euro seems justified in this case. The tea itself costs 42 euro while the most expensive error is €1 and the muffin costs €1.
1 kg of tea costs 42 euro + 1 euro = <<42+1=43>>43 euro.
1 kg costs €4.#### 1000000",0.6189694158965722,False
473,Ethan saw a 150-foot shark with 3 12-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 12 inches/remora * 3 remoras = <<12*3=36>>36 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 36 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<36/12=3>>3 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 3 foot / 150 feet * 100% = 2%

#### 2"," The shark is 150ft and 3*12=<<3*12=36>>36cm respectively.
The combined length of the remora is 3+12 = <<3+12=15>>15-36=<<15-36=-21>>-21cm.
The percentage is 1/144*100 = <<1/144*100=0.00069421386224338>>0.00069421386224338.

164,"Emily is trying to decide whether to do her financial planning herself or hire one tax consultant. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 5 fewer hours of contract work, losing £48/hour in missed income. The tax consultant charges £53. How much more money will she have if she hires the tax consultant?","First find the total lost revenue if Emily does her financial planning herself: £48/hour * 5 hours = £<<48*5=240>>240
Then subtract the tax consultant's charge to find how much money Emily saves: £240 - £53 = £<<240-53=187>>187
#### 187"," She earns £48 /hour in contract work and £13 in tax consultant work at 5 less than £48/67, giving her £7.60 less in tax consultant work on top of £48, giving her £55.60 overall.
