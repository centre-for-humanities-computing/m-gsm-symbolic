930,"When Abby watches her nephew, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 65 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 48 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 13 multicolored rings on it. Abby recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 158. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Abby has 65 + 48 + 13 + T = 126 + T = 158 toys for her nephew.
Thus, T = 158 - 126 = <<158-126=32>>32 bouncy balls came in the tube.

473,William saw a 20-foot dolphin with 4 3-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 3 inches/remora * 4 remoras = <<3*4=12>>12 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<12/12=1>>1 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 20 feet * 100% = 5%

#### 5"," The total length of the dolphin and the remoras is 20 feet (4 remoras * 15feet (4 remoras * >>20 feet=%%<4*(72)**+%1.5+%1.3+(9+9)*225feet>=45feet))
