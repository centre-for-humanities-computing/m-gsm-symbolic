1088,There are 5 periods in the day for a normal student but Joe has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/4 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 classes a day
That means he spends 35*8=<<35*8=280>>280 minutes per day in class
So he spends 280*6=<<280*6=1680>>1680 minutes a week
That means he spends 1680*1/4=<<1680*1/4=420>>420 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 1680+420+420=<<1680+420+420=2520>>2520 minutes per week
So he spends 2520/60=<<2520/60=42>>42 hours per week
#### 42"," First find out how many minutes he spends on class time each day: 5 classes/day * 35 minutes/class = 175 minutes/day
Then calculate how many mode he spends in class on a weekly basis: 175 minutes/day * 6 day/week = 1050 minutes/week
Then figure out how many minutes he spends learning over the week:#### 520008555553454756456454545454545454545134301542545402262235765632112193914954193443444391139489223151463834342322602442180638462142417323244222544524235184311212938112843783974394424652242998575814774342275557954555675777475346219459334372517234344271086418991443124163323262742123253122118187333575657983316416722272336767439183335174341122277182727225662102154221332262187127306267428149343732343235324423193276144343773538144345144135654445533126664322512438112234234621341151653337164631254195133238675177177197134646571497543273683916774537342219111155222444336773635442435551435335816311332377365158734369133282778353719553457556135734218337745221111334276196227911542377867337455321235044012133334635223444261966991151373216765123331346115336134311312453187454343335566326475675665623221574547546873332511117653723103334573513547131132761155169933773421159448633345645666212336111434477331337213746554161361452121111436611465645355368603334244117612123521428635363533761341962416235213322336233175111533551133755111131155161257523291613551315531135553332433683475766771147331623345135221256166766736354316155553551591505331373593541313151414335434312435156571754561385332353746551321322951245611721571355414621511326131331563153112551514117455494576346",5.225507354945876,False

1247,"Tyler has a bag of buttons with 30 inside. He tripped over a rock while carrying it and dropped two thirds of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 8. When he went back home, he inspected the buttons further. Six of the ones he picked up weren't buttons, but actually beads so he got rid of them. How many buttons did Tyler end up with?","Tyler dropped his buttons and was left with 30*1/3=<<30*1/3=10>>10 buttons.

He went home and removed six beads, leaving him with 18-6=<<18-6=12>>12 buttons.
#### 12"," You figure out how many buttons Tyler dropped to start: 30 buttons * 2/3 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 buttons
You add the remaining buttons to the ones he found later: 8 buttons + 10 buttons = 18 buttons.
So Tyler ends up with 10 buttons.

The kernels increase to six times the initial popping rate in the next 24 seconds, but in the final 24 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 24 seconds. After Noah takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 24 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat.

Then multiply the amount one gnome can mine in a day with a diamond pickaxe by the number of gnomes: 13 pounds/day/gnome * 23 gnomes = <<13*23=310>>310 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 310 pounds/day * 31 days = <<310*31=9625>>9625 pounds/day

496,David is 13 years old. In four years his sister Emily will be thrice as old as David is now. How old is Emily right now?,"Four years from now Emily will be 13*3=<<13*3=39>>39.
Right now Emily is 39-4=<<39-4=35>>35 years old.
#### 35"," In four years David will be 13 + 4 = 17 years old. Emily's age in four years is 3 * 17 = 51.
Emily is now 19 less than in four years, so her age is 51 - 19 = <<51-19=32>>32 years old.
The answer is 32

991,Comet Encke orbits the sun every 60 years. David's father saw the Comet when he was 21 years old. David saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was David when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"David saw the Comet for the second time when he was 21 years * 3= <<21*3=63>>63 years old.
Comet Encke can be seen every 60 years, so David saw the comet for the first time when he was 63 years - 60 years = <<63-60=3>>3 years old.
#### 3"," When David's father saw the Comet, David's current age is 3*(21) = 63.
When David's father saw the Comet, he was 21 years old. Therefore, it has been 63 - 21 = <<63-21=42>>42 years since David's father saw the Comet.

473,Ethan saw a 20-foot dolphin with 8 3-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 3 inches/remora * 8 remoras = <<3*8=24>>24 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 24 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<24/12=2>>2 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 2 foot / 20 feet * 100% = 10%

#### 10"," The remoras are 8 * 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 inches or 2 feet.
So the combined length of the remoras is 2/20 * 100 = 10% of the dolphin's body length.

1053,"Emma qualified for a spot on the swimming team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a sports bra for €19, a pair of swimming shorts for €5 more than the sports bra cost, and a pair of sneakers that were originally €48 but were on sale for three quarters price. She had a coupon for €1 off the package of €11 athletic headbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?","The shorts were €5 more than the sports bra, so they cost €5 + €19 = €<<5+19=24>>24.
Her sneakers were three quarters the original €48 price, so they cost €48*3/4=€36.
With her coupon, the headbands were €11 - €1 = €<<11-1=10>>10.
The sports bra, shorts, sneakers, and headbands together cost €19 + €24 + €36 + €10 = €<<19+24+36+10=89>>89.
#### 89"," The pair of water shoes was €48 / 4 = €12 (3/4 of 48).
The sports shorts were €19 + €5 = €24.
So  they cost €19 + €12 + €24 + (€11 - 1) = €65.

406,"At Alex's house, there are four times as many kiwis as cannolis. He has a total of 55 cannolis in his house. Alex bought 46 more cannolis at the store and 22 fewer kiwis than the number of cannolis. Find the combined total of the number of kiwis and cannolis Alex has in the house?","Before buying any kiwi and cannoli, Alex had four times as many kiwis as cannolis, which is 55 cannolis*4 kiwi/cannoli = <<55*4=220>>220 kiwis
The total number of kiwis and cannolis that Alex had before is 220 kiwis + 55 cannolis = <<220+55=275>>275 items
When he bought 22 fewer kiwis than cannolis, he bought 46 kiwis - 22 kiwis = <<46-22=24>>24 kiwis
In total, he bought 24 kiwis + 46 cannolis = <<24+46=70>>70 items
After the purchases, Alex has 275 items + 70 items = <<275+70=345>>345 total kiwis and cannolis combined.
#### 345"," Alex has 4 * 55 = 220 kiwis
Alex bought 46 + 55 = <<46+55=101>>101 cannolis
Alex has 55 - 22 = <<55-22=33>>33 kiwis.
In total, Alex has 220 + 33 + 101 = 354 cannolis and kiwis

If he works seven days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 7*4=<<7*4=28>>28 days.
