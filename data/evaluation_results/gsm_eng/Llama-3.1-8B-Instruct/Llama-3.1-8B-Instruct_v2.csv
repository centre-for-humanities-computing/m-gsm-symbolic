If he also paid $420,000 for the remaining loan amount of the condo, how much is Dr. Williams's net proceeds from selling the condo?","Dr. Williams paid $670,000*1/100 = $6700 for the legal fees.
He paid $670,000*4/100 = $26,800 for the agent fee.
So, Dr. Williams paid a total of $6700 + $26,800 + $420,000 = $453,500 for the legal, agent, and loan fees.
Hence, Dr. Williams's net proceeds is $670,000 - $453,500 = $216,500.

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+20=340
Subtracting the 20 from both sides, we get 2x=320
We divide each side by two, leaving x=160. This means Ethan has 160 meters of fence left over.
#### 160"," Because Kenneth got 20 meters more than Ethan, Ethan has 340 - (340 - 20)/2*2 = 340 - 160 = <<340-(340-20)/2*2=180>>180 meters
The amount left over for Ethan is therefore 180 meters.

410,"Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $39 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $5 per pound, get 1 pound 1/12 off."" She scooped up 3 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $3.0 and 8 magnets that were $0.0 each. How much money does Sally have left?","Sally is buying 1 pound for $5 and gets 1 pound 1/12 off. So 1/12 off of 1 pound is $5*1/12 = $0.4166666666666667. The rest of 1 pound does not have discount and costs 1*$5 = $5, so total is $5+$55/12+$5=$175/12
8 magnets at $0 each is 8*0=$<<8*0=0>>0
When you add all her purchases, 175/12+$3+$0 = $<<175/12+3+0=17>>17
She had $39 and spent $17 so she had $39-$17 = $<<39-17=22>>22 left over
