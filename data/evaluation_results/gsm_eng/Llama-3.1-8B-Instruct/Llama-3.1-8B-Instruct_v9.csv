Thus, in total, it takes Isabella 60+17.5 = <<60+17.5=77.5>>77.5 minutes to walk her favorite route.
#### 77.5"," First find the number of minutes Isabella spends on the sidewalk. Her walk is 19 ft and she walks 7 ft on the walk, that is equals to 1.89 minutes of total walk time. Now divide this 1.89 minutes to 12 min at the beach and 60 minutes in total walk:
1.89 / 60 = 3.15 min walk on the walk * 7 ft / 3.1#### 18980101898984381989380026680861125260111212830401073023645286828348892631249366974523984942290091003902520233032047263023994335322441419959142327108952091039125235421011221740528376947319402933830638285011103193331235189452025347432087030418183429572738521010373555613069003363157291236033451324138231724485922931116351072828198831022316630642123243341427658236215232104251693431323666244626012286094216213314532914098120826283210314950247213914227424015942325594701227214955123242743350833164950264132552721834984231110725241351063910879813186165248322165941672995262165668796914552233958184663449263496325170142049213139037498108744227317578612137336113975971265995665027661114001441659717638228538741426053409512170509540859067979439733670559173263883517136151725167336369556178213394154424788835005880272344765932484977465719136214204178452813645698653123399217916668618770644313779403519637016245133025881690101235799257886239324475584463612916789790190317773718439794896848946907235339165318187835978327211108618108746407824355498774118317423111933351580165741615730439028283377443182795638144511186209619247587947701210333419149346151112249732341971491671593513976201371415949",7.040523612056859,False
434,The vending machines sell crackers for 35 cents and pretzels for 105 cents. Chris spent $10 and got 2 bags of crackers and had 9% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?,"Chris got $0.9 in change because $10*9/100 = <<10*9/100=0.9>>0.9
Chris spent $9.1 because 10 - 0.9 = <<10-0.9=9.1>>9.1
Chris spent $0.7 on crackers because 2*0.35 = <<2*0.35=0.7>>0.7
Chris spent 8.4 on pretzels because 9.1 - 0.7 = <<9.1-0.7=8.4>>8.4
Chris bought 8 pretzels because 8.4 / 1.05 = <<8=8>>8
#### 8"," Chris spent 100 cents - 35 cents * 2 - 9% * 100 cents = 100 cents - 70 cents - 9 cents = 21 cents.
Then convert his percentage change to cents. 100 cents * 0.09 = 9 cents
Then find the total cents spent and subtract the 70 cents for the crackers. 105 cents - 21 cents = 84 cents per pack of pretzels#### 8463501952521000016097242351275045006568051570429510015098665040900085101203281316526619251025005040012850151084496045951492386285091091025002324775110064149440505340490540001450010151372218150276849103282515145103777151031102272310050821035211213006109005100940926501627412935004104905001173221050110100245280113130784130406626073115965530640815058922101140516099920416077129440437122600177361504731936652550010011020114000314013119553112058687712116057901551014061756771701016282101483161632753510707613274610503601001878930133456125996456405305136675533725561195119982991711222209856735478512972910510121197652932435878104751207954540805126606096025643425411208113235406684369911940656104087325305161514634905130410115325170650739140105103409757895462170123105210412453695305639359814755229075902110032546342656610722503299440842509151279997202261109064835807087982535452201624474345120215211599011020312555652630553564900402207259939110161667727111731540157814210414635011617630042551611315583694307891224108715945632220734409400108206334576105932184817277668174070925046710901196756619845555871505506840715810009509395132277940610669321115236550094904404410315040563553665044035056411053",2.9975891469512135,False
459,"A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of hay, wheats, beets and apples. Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys four 2-lb boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 12-lb bags. Hay are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty-two 60-lb packs. Wheats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1650 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 lbs of apples.
He is buying 6*12 = <<6*12=72>>72 lbs of beets.
He is buying 20*65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 lbs of wheats.
He is buying 32*60 = <<32*60=1920>>1920 lbs of hay.
The weight of all the feed is 8 + 72 + 1300 + 1920 = <<8+72+1300+1920=3300>>3300 lbs.
Thus, the farmer needs 3300 / 1650 = <<3300/1650=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.
#### 2"," First, find the total weight of hay by multiplying the number of sacks by the weight per sack: 32 sacks * 60 lb/sack = 1920 lb
Next, find the total weight of wheat by multiplying the number of sacks by the weight per sack: 20 sacks * 65 lb/sack = 1300 lb

184,Kenneth is rolling a 10-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"There are 8 numbers greater than 2 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 8/10=80%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 80% - 25% = 55%.
#### 55"," The probability of rolling a number greater than 2: (10/10) * ((7/10) or = 7/10) = 7/10 or = 70%*

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: (2/10)*(2/10) = (2/10)^2 = *1/25* * 100% = 4%
Therefore, the difference in the probabilities is 70% - 4% = 66%*

If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in eight hours if she spends one quarter of the time running and three quarters of the time walking?","If Anna can skip at three fifths the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*5/3=<<3*5/3=5>>5 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is five times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 5/5=1 miles per hour.
If three quarters of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 8*3/4=<<8*3/4=6>>6 hours.
If one quarter of the time is spent running, then she runs for 8-6=<<8-6=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 5 miles per hour, or 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 miles.
She walks for 6 hours at 1 miles per hour, or 6*1=<<6*1=6>>6 miles.

Now figure out how much silage total the ducks need: 9 kilograms/duck * 50 ducks = <<9*50=450>>450 kilograms
Now figure out how much silage total the goats need: 6 kilograms/goat * 43 goats = <<6*43=258>>258 kilograms
Now add the two amounts of silage to find the total: 450 kilograms + 258 kilograms = <<450+258=708>>708 kilograms

1026,One troll can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with basic shovel. He can mine twice as much with a silver pickaxe and 50% more with a bronze pickaxe than with a silver pickaxe. How many kgs of ore can 20 trolls with bronze pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?,"First find how much ore a troll can mine with an silver pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 kgs/day
Then multiply that amount by 150% to find how much a troll can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 kgs/day * 150% = <<10*150*.01=15>>15 kgs/day
Then multiply the amount one troll can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of trolls: 15 kgs/day/troll * 20 trolls = <<15*20=300>>300 kgs/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 300 kgs/day * 28 days = <<300*28=8400>>8400 kgs/day
#### 8400"," First let's calculate how many kgs of ore one troll with a bronze pickaxe can mine in a day: 5kg * 2kg (because of the silver pickaxe) * 1.5kg (because of the bronze pickaxe) = 15kg of ore per day
So 20 trolls with bronze pickaxes mine a total of 15 kg * 20 trolls = 300kg of ore per day

1084,"If David and Michael have 940 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Michael getting 160 yards more than David, how much is left over for David?","Let x be the amount of fence David gets and y be the amount Michael gets. We know that y = x + 160, and y + x = 940.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+160=940
Subtracting the 160 from both sides, we get 2x=780
We divide each side by two, leaving x=390. This means David has 390 yards of fence left over.
#### 390"," First we need to solve for how much fence David has. David has: 940 - 160 / 2 yards = 940 - 80 yards = 860 yards
There are 2 extra yards remaining by doing this calculation.
860 is incorrect. We are using 940 - 160 to find the 2 yards.
Use this formula instead: second: First:  (940 - total)* 160 / ####
