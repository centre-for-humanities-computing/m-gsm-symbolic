1026,One miner can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe and 40% more with a bronze pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe. How many kgs of ore can 20 miners with bronze pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?,"First find how much ore a miner can mine with an bronze pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 kgs/day
Then multiply that amount by 140% to find how much a miner can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 kgs/day * 140% = <<10*140*.01=14>>14 kgs/day
Then multiply the amount one miner can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of miners: 14 kgs/day/miner * 20 miners = <<14*20=280>>280 kgs/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 280 kgs/day * 30 days = <<280*30=8400>>8400 kgs/day
#### 8400"," First convert 30 to a decimal to make the calculation easy: 30days/30 = 1 month

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking?","If Ella can skip at two thirds the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*3/2=<<6*3/2=9>>9 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is thrice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 9/3=3 miles per hour.
If half of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*1/2=<<6*1/2=3>>3 hours.
If half of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 hours.
Thus, she runs for 3 hours at 9 miles per hour, or 3*9=<<3*9=27>>27 miles.
She walks for 3 hours at 3 miles per hour, or 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 miles.

661,Ethan goes to the store to buy some flour. The normal brand of flour he buys costs $22 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 1 kg of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for $5. How much did everything cost?,"The flour he bought was 22*0.4=$<<22*0.4=8>>8 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys
So it cost 22+8=$<<22+8=30>>30 per kg
He goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kgs of flour a week
So he paid 30.8*7=$<<30.8*7=215>>215 on flour
That means his total bill was 215+5=$<<215+5=220>>220
#### 220"," The normal brand of flour costs 22 dollars per kg.
The more expensive brand costs $22 per kg + $22*40/100 = $22 + $8.80
The expensive brand cost $22 + $8.80 = $30.80 per kg
He buys flour per day but he needs 7 days worth of flour.
Therefore, he buys 1*7 = <<7=7>>7 kgs of flour

Let's rewrite this so it can be solved algebraically.
Carl swims a mile in <<12=12>>12 minutes in the cold water.
Carl swims a mile in 2*12 + 5 = <<2*12+5=29>>29 minutes in the warm water.
Carl needs 12/1 = <<12=12>>12 miles to swim in the warm water.

Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the care facility after 3 weeks.","If 1/8 of the total capacity of the care facility beds is occupied, it means 1/8 * 1200 = <<1200*1/8=150>>150 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the care facility without new admissions is 1200 beds - 150 beds = <<1200-150=1050>>1050 beds.
If 30 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the care facility after one week is 30 patients/day * 7 days/week = 210 patients.
After 3 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the care facility is 210 patients/week * 3 weeks = <<210*3=630>>630 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 1050 unoccupied beds in the care facility before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1050 beds - 630 beds = <<1050-630=420>>420 unoccupied beds.

989,Jessica can peel 10 onions a minute and saute 30 onions in 17 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 180 onions?,"First find how long it takes Jessica to peel the onions: 180 onions / 10 onions/minute = <<180/10=18>>18 minutes
Then find how many batches of onions she needs to cook: 180 onions / 30 onions/batch = <<180/30=6>>6 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 6 batches * 17 minutes/batch = <<6*17=102>>102 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Jessica spends: 102 minutes + 18 minutes = <<102+18=120>>120 minutes
#### 120"," 17*30/60=8.5 onions, which means that Jessica can only sauté 180-8.5=171.5 onions.
However, she can only peel 180-171.5=8.5 onions in the time it takes her to sauté the onions, but she can only peel 10 onions a minute.
It will therefore take her 8.5*60/10=51 minutes to peel 180 onions.

1025,The Scavenger hunt team hid 90 candies. The Lee twins each found 18 candies. All the other candies except 19 were found by their friends. How many candies did the friends find?,"The Lee twins found, 18 * 2 = <<18*2=36>>36 candies.
The number that remained hidden was 90 - 36 = <<90-36=54>>54 candies
Since 19 candies were not found, this means the friends found 54 - 19 = 35 candies.
#### 35"," The Lee twins together found 18 candies*2 = <<18*2=36>>36 candies.
There are 19 candies + 36 candies = <<19+36=55>>55 candies still hidden.

1165,Joshua collects garbage from 6 different apartment complexes. The first five have 400 apartments each and the last one is 55% bigger than the other five combined.

How much money does he make in a week?,"The first five complexes have 5*400=<<5*400=2000>>2000 apartments
Number 6 has 2000*0.55=<<2000*0.55=1100>>1100 more apartments than those five combined.
So in total, it has 2000+1100=<<2000+1100=3100>>3100 apartments.
So in total, he goes to 3100+2000=<<3100+2000=5100>>5100 apartments each time
That means he visits 5100*2=<<5100*2=10,200>>10,200 apartments every week
So he makes 10,200*€0.2=€<<10,200*0.2=2040>>2040 every week
#### 2040"," Joshua makes his €0.2 charge for garbage collection for every apartment, and he does these 2 times a week. He therefore makes substantially more * 400 units * 2 collections than for about half the other five apartment complexes units.

473,Laura saw a 20-foot shark with 4 3-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 3 inches/remora * 4 remoras = <<3*4=12>>12 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<12/12=1>>1 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 20 feet * 100% = 5%

#### 5"," The remoras have combined length of 4*3 = <<4*3=12>>12 inches
12 inches = 12/12 = 1 foot since 1 foot has 12 inches.
Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.
The combined length of the remoras and shark is 20 feet + 1 foot = 21 feet.
We divide 1 foot for the remoras by 21 feet for a#### 100077744509539393490411109345290718560391310632548511129392685267797671093916711996269190971331037770831313569751986592918352673224801381875178672203167141538106998337193281220268112520397260095675003241879410941134612963541158876845377124127896224642056114415571231177944164169276940337774720163716870705651038871646571967392330265436008908216131833747522354643205421644765388703765661151467675624105286074193603933912411750722144212110821371361190219934769083302422642631279665213117682225256145814144352955394889354188543154225103092313830168111313770658327041129675347821195541050511761011774650389437776784941567223819573351116776049433113848467951070542136174894234986999337151422487215047598495415331229998875744865166841899655571768291996176641714571521737551952720163137404348654173981191414385819896111842677197471477713447533513794248917797517746808895109997148842681235167054432926937803013635216615903179343230419158826955476197124667176174776817766590818021268187776513412566801569181153551675417495030594825077422635995341121647776736041136553756431944514184921784811420663217632275249679335310615962499223792296541181543295726134662977354713767942323143346401491844855677337671440",3.0116008250042796,False

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+150=220

434,The vending machines sell pretzels for 50 cents and cookies for 70 cents. William spent £10 and got 7 bags of pretzels and had 9% of his money left in change. How many cookies did he buy?,"William got £0.9 in change because £10*9/100 = <<10*9/100=0.9>>0.9
William spent £9.1 because 10 - 0.9 = <<10-0.9=9.1>>9.1
William spent £3.5 on pretzels because 7*0.5 = <<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5
William spent 5.6 on cookies because 9.1 - 3.5 = <<9.1-3.5=5.6>>5.6
William bought 8 cookies because 5.6 / 0.7 = <<8=8>>8
#### 8"," William got 7 bags of pretzels. The amount spent on pretzels is 7*50 cents = £3.50
This means that the amount he spent on cookies is £10 - £3.50 = £6.5
The number of cookies he bought is therefore 6.5/0.7 = 9.28 approx.
He can only buy whole numbers of cookies, he has bought 9 cookies.
