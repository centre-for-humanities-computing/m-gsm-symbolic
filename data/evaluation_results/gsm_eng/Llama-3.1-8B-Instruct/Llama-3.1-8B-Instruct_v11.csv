520,"Amanda is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a sweater, vest, cardigan, mittens, and leg warmers for each of them. It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a sweater, 10 for a vest, 13 for a cardigan, 18 for a pair of mittens, and 16 for a pair of leg warmers. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?","A full outfit for each child will require 5 skeins per sweater + 10 skeins per vest + 13 skeins per cardigan + 18 skeins per pair of mittens + 16 skeins per pair of leg warmers = <<5+10+13+18+16=62>>62 skeins of wool.
So to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3*62 = <<3*62=186>>186 skeins of wool.
#### 186"," It takes 5 + 10 + 13 + 18 + 16 = <<5+10+13+18+16=62>>62 skeins to make all the clothes for one of the children.
For all 3, she will need 62 * 3 = <<62*3=186>>186 skeins of wool.

473,Emma saw a 60-foot shark with 4 36-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 36 inches/remora * 4 remoras = <<36*4=144>>144 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 144 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<144/12=12>>12 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 12 foot / 60 feet * 100% = 20%

#### 20"," 4 remoras have length 4*36 = <<4*36=144>>144.
Because 144/60 = 2.4, the remoras are 2.4 times as long as the shark
Therefore, the remoras are 2.4*100% = 240% of the fish's length.
The answer is 240. Long Answer.

1099,"The biggest waterslide at Water Wonderland is 380 meters long, and people slide down at 65 meters/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 220 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 85 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?","First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 380 meters / 65 meters/minute = <<380/65=5>>5 minutes
Then find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 220 meters / 85 meters/minute = <<220/85=2>>2 minutes
Then subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 5 minutes - 2 minutes = <<5-2=3>>3 minutes
#### 3"," To find how long it takes to slide 380 meters at 65 m/minute, divide 380 by 65 to get 5.85 minutes.
To find how long it takes to slide 220 meters at 85 m/minute, divide 220 by 85 to get 2.59 minutes.
So after subtracting the smaller number from the larger number, we find 5.85 - 2.59 = 3.26.

1268,"A pyramid is made out of 4 purple cubes, twice as many black cubes, and an unknown number of green cubes. If there are 21 cubes in the pyramid in total, how many green cubes are there?","There are 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 black cubes in the pyramid.
There are 21-4-8 = <<21-4-8=9>>9 green cubes in the pyramid.
#### 9"," Let x be the number of green cubes.  Since there are twice as many black cubes as purple cubes, then you can add this up to find that 4+2*4+x = 12+x.
This expression is equal to 21. Thus, since 21-12 = 9 and 9=x, there are 9 green cubes.
The answer is 9.

The rest of the cods are 4-2 = <<4-2=2>>2. He will earn 30*£0.75 = £<<30*0.75=22.5>>22.5 per each of them. So he will earn 2 * 22.5 = <<2*22.5>>=45
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the cods is £42.75 + £42 + £45= £<<42.75+42+45=129>>129.
#### 129"," The weight of the two unknown cods to be deducted is (57 + 56) = 113 kgs.
Given that the total weight of the cods caught is 113 + 30 = 143 kgs. The unknown cods' weights would be: 4 * 36 = 144 kgs, or 143 kgs. The second is more likely.
Therefore, the two unknown cods cost £ 0.75 * 143 = £ 107.25.

459,"A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of oats, apples, carrots and corns. Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys six 2-lb boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 8-lb bags. Oats are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty 65-lb packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys eighteen 55-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1500 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 lbs of corns.
He is buying 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 lbs of carrots.
He is buying 18*55 = <<18*55=990>>990 lbs of apples.
He is buying 30*65 = <<30*65=1950>>1950 lbs of oats.
The weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 990 + 1950 = <<12+48+990+1950=3000>>3000 lbs.
Thus, the farmer needs 3000 / 1500 = <<3000/1500=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.
#### 2"," First, let's convert the weight of each item into pounds.

It took 18*55=<<18*55=990>>990 pounds of apples.

If the brownies cost €11 and the melon pie cost €27, how much did Ethan earn for two days?","He sold 25 + 11 = <<25+11=36>>36 boxes of brownies on Wednesday.
The total number of boxes of brownies that Ethan sold is 25 + 36 = <<25+36=61>>61.
Ethan earned 61*€11 = €<<61*11=671>>671 for selling brownies.
He sold 29 - 6 = <<29-6=23>>23 boxes of melon pie on Tuesday.
The total number of boxes of melon pie that Ethan sold is 29 + 23 = <<29+23=52>>52.
He earned 52*€27 = €<<52*27=1404>>1404 for selling melon pie.

39,"Anna can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 5 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?","If Anna can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 10/2=5 miles per hour.
If two thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*2/3=<<6*2/3=4>>4 hours.
If one third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 10 miles per hour, or 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 5 miles per hour, or 4*5=<<4*5=20>>20 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 20+20=<<20+20=40>>40 miles.
#### 40"," Since she can walk at 5/2 = 2.5 miles per hour and run at 5*2 = 10 miles per hour, it takes her 5/2 hours to walk six miles and 6/10 = 0.6 hours to run 6 miles.
She can run for 6*(1/3) =6 hours out of 12 total hours.
Therefore, she can run 6*10 = 60 miles, walk 6*2.5 = 15.

If each serving of cookies has 250 calories and I only have 1250 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 1250/250 of a serving = 5 of a serving
We also know that a 300 oz bag of cookies has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300 oz/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 ozs
If I can only eat 5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60 oz * 5 = 300 ozs
#### 300"," Since you can consume 2200 - 950 = 1250 calories today, you can have 1250/250 = 5 servings.
Since there are a total 5 servings in the bag, there are a total of 5 * 300 = <<5*300=1500>>1500 ozs in the bag.

This means that Oliver has used up 35 ozs of water because 16 plus 16 plus 3 equals 35.
Oliver has 65 ozs of water left because 100 minus 35 equals <<100-35=65>>65.
#### 65"," For the giant cubes, he will need 4 * 4 = 16 ozs.
For the medium cubes, he will need 8 * 2 = 16 ozs.
For the small cubes, he will need 15 / 5 * 1 = 3 ozs.
So he will need 16 + 16 + 3 = <<4*4=16, 8*2=16, 15/5*1=3, 16+16+3=35>>35 ozs.

937,"Carl is feeding his livestock grain. Each goat needs 10 pounds, and each cow needs 9 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. If there are 25 goats and 27 cows, how many pounds of grain does Carl need?","First figure out how much grain each cow needs: 10 pounds * 2 - 9 = <<10*2-9=11>>11 pounds/cow
Now figure out how much grain total the cows need: 11 pounds/cow * 27 cows = <<11*27=297>>297 pounds
Now figure out how much grain total the goats need: 10 pounds/goat * 25 goats = <<10*25=250>>250 pounds
Now add the two amounts of grain to find the total: 297 pounds + 250 pounds = <<297+250=547>>547 pounds
#### 547"," Each cow needs 2*10-9=<<2*10-9=11>>11 pounds of grain.
So all of the goats need 25*10=<<25*10=250>>250 pounds of grain.

Total required is 250+297=547.
