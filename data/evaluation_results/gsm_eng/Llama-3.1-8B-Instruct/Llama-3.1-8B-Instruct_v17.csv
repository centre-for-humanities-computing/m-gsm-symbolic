459,"A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys a variety of apples, hay, beets and wheats. Since wheats are a rare treat, he only buys six 2-ounce boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the cows while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 8-ounce bags. Apples are the main diet of his cows, so he buys forty-two 70-ounce packs. Hay are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys eighteen 50-ounce sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1950 ounces at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 ounces of wheats.

He is buying 42*70 = <<42*70=2940>>2940 ounces of apples.
The weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 900 + 2940 = <<12+48+900+2940=3900>>3900 ounces.

#### 2"," First, we calculate the total amount of feed delivered to the stable in ounces.   Wheats total six * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 ounces.

        Apples total forty-two * 70 = <<42*70=2940>>2940 ounces.

How much more is the total price of the townhouse than Dr. Patel's budget?","The brokerage fee is $310,000*5/100 = $<<310,000*5/100=15,500>>15,500.
The transfer fee is $310,000*11/100 = $<<310,000*11/100=34,100>>34,100.
The total price of the townhouse is $310,000 + $15,500 + $34,100 = $359,600.
So, it is $359,600 - $320,000 = $<<359,600-320,000=39,600>>39,600 more than Dr. Patel's budget.

If Jessica is sure to get 45% of the geography questions, and three quarters of the geometry and physics questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?","The geometry and physics questions comprises 100% - 20% = 80% of the quiz.
There are 30 questions*20/100 = <<30*20/100=6>>6 geography questions.
There are a total of 30 questions*80/100 = <<30*80/100=24>>24 geometry and physics questions.
If Jessica is sure to get 45% of the geography questions, then this means she is sure of her 6 questions*45/100 = <<6*45/100=2>>2 points.
From the geometry and physics questions, she is sure to get three quarters of it correctly so that is 24 questions*3/4 = <<24*3/4=18>>18 points.
Thus, she is sure of getting 2 points + 18 points = <<2+18=20>>20 points in her quiz.

266,"Dr. Jones sold his villa for $830,000. He paid the registration fees that amount to 1% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 4% of the selling price. If he also paid $670,000 for the remaining loan amount of the villa, how much is Dr. Jones's net proceeds from selling the villa?","Dr. Jones paid $830,000*1/100 = $8300 for the registration fees.
He paid $830,000*4/100 = $33,200 for the realtor fee.
So, Dr. Jones paid a total of $8300 + $33,200 + $670,000 = $711,500 for the registration, realtor, and loan fees.
Hence, Dr. Jones's net proceeds is $830,000 - $711,500 = $118,500.
