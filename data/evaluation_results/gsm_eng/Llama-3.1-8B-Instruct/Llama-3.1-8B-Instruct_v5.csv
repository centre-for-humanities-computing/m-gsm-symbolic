If a kilogram of tune costs $1.0, how much will he earn after selling all the tunes to the market?","Henry will earn 64*$1 = $<<64*1=64>>64 from the first tune.
He will earn 41*$1 = $<<41*1=41>>41 for the second tune.
The rest of the tunes are 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5. He will earn 20*$1 = $<<20*1=20>>20 per each of them. So he will earn 5 * 20 = <<5*20>>=100
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunes is $64 + $41 + $100= $<<64+41+100=205>>205.

Matt uses 14*2=28 kg of rice per week, so it costs him 28 kg * £24.65/kg = £691.80

955,"A hospital has a capacity of 1300 beds with 1/10 occupied. Due to the major accident, 30 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.","If 1/10 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/10 * 1300 = <<1300*1/10=130>>130 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1300 beds - 130 beds = <<1300-130=1170>>1170 beds.
If 30 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 30 patients/day * 7 days/week = 210 patients.
After 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 210 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<210*2=420>>420 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 1170 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1170 beds - 420 beds = <<1170-420=750>>750 unoccupied beds.
#### 750"," First, we need to calculate the total number of occupied beds in the hospital before admitting new patients.
There are 1300 beds in the hospital with 1/10 occupied.
1/10 occupied is equal to (1/10)*1300 = 130/10 = <<1/10*1300=130>>130

184,Michael is rolling a 6-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 4 numbers greater than 2 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 4/6=66%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 66% - 25% = 41%.
#### 41"," A simple die roll is symmetrical.  Every number has the same probability of being rolled. Therefore, there is a 50% probability that he rolls a number greater than 2.
The probability that the rolls are odd odd is 1/2 * 1/2 = 0.25.  This is 50% less than 50%, which is equivalent to 0.25 / 0.5 = 0.5,#### 50",1.5333474609069526,False

There are 8+16 = <<8+16=24>>24 infected people after the first day.
On the second day, 24*2 = <<24*2=48>>48 more people are infected.
There are 24 + 48 = <<24+48=72>>72 infected people after the second day.
On the third day, 72*2 = 144 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 72 + 144 = 216 infected people after three days.
#### 216"," Start with the 8 people.
The 8 people infect 2 each in first day for a total of 8*2= <<8*2=16>>16. After first day 16 + 8 = 24 people.

930,"When Abby watches her nephew, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 65 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 48 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 13 multicolored rings on it. Abby recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 158. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Abby has 65 + 48 + 13 + T = 126 + T = 158 toys for her nephew.
Thus, T = 158 - 126 = <<158-126=32>>32 bouncy balls came in the tube.
#### 32"," To solve for the number of bouncy balls, subtract the total number of toys before the bouncy balls from the total number of toys now. Before the bouncy balls, there were 65 + 48 = 113 toys.
158 total toys - 113 toys before the bouncy balls = 45 bouncy balls.
The answer is 45.

473,William saw a 20-foot dolphin with 4 3-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 3 inches/remora * 4 remoras = <<3*4=12>>12 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<12/12=1>>1 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 20 feet * 100% = 5%

#### 5"," William noticed that the dolphin is 20 foot long and the remoras have a combined length of 4 *3= 12
