1277,"Matt and Madison are currently 27 years apart in age. If Matt, who is younger than Madison, is 16 years old, what's the average of their ages?","If Matt is 16 years old, Madison is 16+27 = <<16+27=43>>43 years old.
The sum of their ages is 43+16 = <<43+16=59>>59 years
The average age of the two is 59/2 = <<59/2=29>>29 years
#### 29"," Madison is 16 + 27 = 43 years old.
The average of their ages is (43 + 16)/ 2 years = 59/2 years = 29.5 years.
The answer is 29.5. 

Problem: Tom is 4 times older than Rachel. 7 years from now, he will be 30 years old. If y represents Rachel's current age, solve for y.

The total number of beds in the clinic without new admissions is 1600 beds - 160 beds = <<1600-160=1440>>1440 beds.
If 35 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the clinic after one week is 35 patients/day * 7 days/week = 245 patients.
After 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the clinic is 245 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<245*2=490>>490 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 1440 unoccupied beds in the clinic before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1440 beds - 490 beds = <<1440-490=950>>950 unoccupied beds.
#### 950"," The clinic currently has 1600*1/10 = 160 patients in the clinic.
So 1600-160=1440 beds are empty.

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+140=440
Subtracting the 140 from both sides, we get 2x=300
We divide each side by two, leaving x=150. This means Abby has 150 yards of fence left over.
#### 150"," If Jason is 140 yards more than Abby, that means their total yards must be a multiple of 140. 440/140 = 3.1, meaning 440 yards divided into 3 multiple of 140 is not a whole number. However, 440/3 = 146.66. 140 * 3 = 420, leaving 20 left over. So 20 feet was left over for Abby for having a smaller Y####

473,Amanda saw a 60-foot shark with 9 20-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 20 inches/remora * 9 remoras = <<20*9=180>>180 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 180 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<180/12=15>>15 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 15 foot / 60 feet * 100% = 25%

#### 25"," First we calculate the total length of the remoras: 9 remoras x 20 inches remora^{-1} = 180 inches = 15 feet.

1133,"Sarah walks 32 feets every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 13 feets of walking on the beach and 19 feet(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Sarah walks at thrice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 52 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 32-feet walk, in minutes?","On the beach, Sarah walks at a rate of 13 feets per 52 minutes, or 13/52 = 1/4 feets per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at thrice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 3*1/4 = 0.75 feets per minute.
To walk 19 feet(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 19/0.75 = <<19/0.75=25.333333333333332>>25.333333333333332 minutes.

#### 77.33333333333333"," Sarah's speed for walking on the beach is 13/52 of her speed for walking on the sidewalk because time equals speed divided by distance and speed equals distance divided by time. So spsidewalk= 19/13*52=152. Therefore, 52 equals 13*spbeach/1, so spbeach=52*13/52= 13, or 13 feets/minute(s).

How much more is the total price of the condo than Dr. Patel's budget?","The brokerage fee is $430,000*6/100 = $<<430,000*6/100=25,800>>25,800.
The transfer fee is $430,000*10/100 = $<<430,000*10/100=43,000>>43,000.
The total price of the condo is $430,000 + $25,800 + $43,000 = $498,800.
So, it is $498,800 - $480,000 = $<<498,800-480,000=18,800>>18,800 more than Dr. Patel's budget.

The difference between these two probabilities is 90% - 25% = 65%.

What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?","While Ashley is processing 44 orders in a day, Abby processes 44 orders/day*4=<<44*4=176>>176 orders/day.
In a day, they process 176 orders/day + 44 orders/day = <<176+44=220>>220 orders together.
The total number of orders the two processes in a week is 220 orders/day * 7 days/week = <<220*7=1540>>1540 orders
#### 1540"," Since the two have an alternating workflow and operate the same amount of time, Abby processes the same number of customers per week as Ashley does. In total, they therefore process twice the number of customers than Ashley does and since Ashley processes 44 customers, that means they process 44*2=#### 88004445990898830999686899979611098944599899690987665458888454778894869608894994339997285896520675046485610759857390898693838896698806615673230480485339002000644088040901996828421578680478968984853309509999465593766954469591084464980012904458814977802712847735118739888455108255124771435997878899813970246549076448690496517356143952219698774512848685294504551929971357885098565399084568974991817830011320409694108446940860859106547963987039196899172479511806255107640155878866145864910799998460600860594579012861558634910379967354122269764381909710570599198948731607965511107765404566684398827495212528562286962394599080424123343828496970649394410984360477570761128535962990713910245573959401021030218599585512964803165821999441865111399222834994474487694234236491205030149927147297971489734816553566377279691217946214713070724890116271750166415108790395594454548458993109252399767505146928492752511209563821474698805395389718623668113698935883821229940601204175940840591953606278843735034934531736786056376188654130648637778985813635954990412111901484489504017332569063558870341577919476159147292438498997863699161579783705566928132875984864514994390409031289551615135376555158443559629798595878819813575208348476440571215421501137203654898247216255609635113529395110129490461563495415562509",12.42570510006044,False

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in eight hours if she spends three quarters of the time running and one quarter of the time walking?","If Jessica can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 12/2=6 miles per hour.

Thus, she runs for 6 hours at 12 miles per hour, or 6*12=<<6*12=72>>72 miles.
