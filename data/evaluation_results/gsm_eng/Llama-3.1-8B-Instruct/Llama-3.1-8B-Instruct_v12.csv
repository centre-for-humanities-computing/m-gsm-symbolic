655,Claire is required to submit a 188-page assignment. She already finished writing 1/4 of the assignment. How many pages does she have left to write?,"Claire has already written 1/4 of the assignment which is 188 pages*1/4 = <<188*1/4=47>>47 pages.
So, she still needs to write 188 pages - 47 pages = <<188-47=141>>141 pages.
#### 141"," Claire has already written 1/4 of 188 pages, so that is 1/4 * 188 = 47 pages.
This means she still has to write 188 - 47 = 141 pages.
The answer is 141.

434,The vending machines sell gum for 75 cents and pretzels for 115 cents. Eric spent $10 and got 6 bags of gum and had 9% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?,"Eric got $0.9 in change because $10*9/100 = <<10*9/100=0.9>>0.9
Eric spent $9.1 because 10 - 0.9 = <<10-0.9=9.1>>9.1
Eric spent $4.5 on gum because 6*0.75 = <<6*0.75=4.5>>4.5
Eric spent 4.6 on pretzels because 9.1 - 4.5 = <<9.1-4.5=4.6>>4.6
Eric bought 4 pretzels because 4.6 / 1.15 = <<4=4>>4
#### 4","  First, let's find out how much change Eric got.
6(0.75) + 0.09 * 10 = 5.8
So he spent 4.2.
How much did the pretzels cost?
He bought 4.2 / 115 = 0.0365 pretzels, but we know he can't buy a fraction of a pretzel.
Thus the solution is to change 4.2 in different combinations of pretzels until you get####

So to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 2*63 = <<2*63=126>>126 skeins of wool.
#### 126"," To make 5 articles of clothing for 2 children, you need to multiply the number of articles of clothing by the number of skeins required per article, and then multiply by 2:
15 + 13 + 16 + 5 + 14 = 63.
63 skeins * 2 (grandchildren) = 126 skeins.

If a 375 oz bag has 5 servings, how many ozs can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2150 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?","If the total calorie target is 2150 and I have consumed 1700 calories then I have 2150-1700 = <<2150-1700=450>>450 calories left to eat
If each serving of popcorn has 300 calories and I only have 450 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 450/300 of a serving = 3/2 of a serving
We also know that a 375 oz bag of popcorn has 5 servings, hence each serving has 375 oz/5 = <<375/5=75>>75 ozs
If I can only eat 3/2 of a serving, then I can eat only 75 oz * 3/2 = 112.5 ozs

459,"A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of corns, oats, beets and hay. Since hay are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-pounds boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pounds bags. Corns are the main diet of his horses, so he buys thirty 70-pounds packs. Oats are a staple to supplement the corns, so he buys nineteen 60-pounds sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1650 poundss at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 4*3 = <<4*3=12>>12 poundss of hay.

The weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 1140 + 2100 = <<12+48+1140+2100=3300>>3300 poundss.

930,"When Amanda watches her cousin, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 38 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 35 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 20 multicolored rings on it. Amanda recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her cousin up to 159. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Amanda has 38 + 35 + 20 + T = 93 + T = 159 toys for her cousin.
Thus, T = 159 - 93 = <<159-93=66>>66 bouncy balls came in the tube.
#### 66"," To find the total number of balls in the tube, first find the total number of the other toys by adding 38 + 35 + 20 = 93.
Next, since the bouncy balls were alone in the tube, you can get the number of the balls by subtracting the other toys: 159 - 93 = 66.
The answer is 66.

#### 170"," In 1 day, 1/4 of 600 rooms is occupied. This means 600 * 1/4 = 150 rooms are occupied.
Since the clinic can't occupy a fraction, there are 150 occupied rooms.
That means there are 600 - 150 = 450 unoccupied rooms.
Since 20 patients are admitted each day, after 2 weeks (or 14 days), 2 weeks * 20 = 2#### 280225351412287197294204253351120256707586011547282274140458072830488718394351210609133487178646856907120726790206663603314266145629454921262462582853322473617943489240915933950474719239224250390073067282305366856425864382056709043856848460792684265539139006492861867256878232957030698252881657841972816871464084621337649662772761554115639478406163546728923777219677211816162666475656485736572746232935034104726919576513614979145616637520199526258670896310179110369116869717630096179633024695482342400696400779454100672992938237102539320763573364420598836622642976051769665037504293677515176519466424296450014618428858636176957151337720739598617391373826661716008395539666569977242318046919333519885154399164631231864998436509336342502432493159187274095733483528666677737194630442712566081344568369306642587865696037642278546056630131426124768670265019682416601118678318810767321923693640335506248432610626572587746561806496522492480426532563842152449437046163624131111106911553542047081278475544128336663251797256585308694641286427362524119241016185405659178799181225506930906296356604365223814222765396656584214843265921267553552235104186398689923105410456276063121635767829911534829",3.4741578260436654,False

473,Emma saw a 400-foot whale with 3 16-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the whale's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 16 inches/remora * 3 remoras = <<16*3=48>>48 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 48 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<48/12=4>>4 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the whale's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 4 foot / 400 feet * 100% = 1%

#### 1"," The combined length of the remoras is 3*16=<<3*16=48>>48 inches.

She bought a t-shirt for $8, a pair of basketball leggings for $13 more than the t-shirt cost, and a pair of athletic shoes that were originally $38 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for $2 off the package of $11 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?","The leggings were $13 more than the t-shirt, so they cost $13 + $8 = $<<13+8=21>>21.

He collects garbage 4 times a week from each place and he gets paid £0.55 per collection for each apartment.

So in total, it has 1050+525=<<1050+525=1575>>1575 apartments.
So in total, he goes to 1575+1050=<<1575+1050=2625>>2625 apartments each time
That means he visits 2625*4=<<2625*4=10,500>>10,500 apartments every week

116,"Lily makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 31:4. If she used a total of 70 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.","The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 31+4 = <<31+4=35>>35
Since the fraction representing the number of teaspoons she used is 31/35, she used 31/35*70 = <<31/35*70=62>>62
#### 62"," The total number of parts is 31 + 4 = 35 parts.
A ratio of 31:4 means she used 31/35 of the total, which is 70 * 31/35 = 56.
The answer is 56.

1264,"Amanda is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 60 pop in the first 26 seconds of cooking, then two times that amount in the next 26 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next 26 seconds, but in the final 26 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 26 seconds. After Amanda takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 26 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Amanda have to eat?","In the second 26 seconds of cooking, 2*60=<<2*60=120>>120 kernels pop.
In the third 26 seconds, 4*60=<<4*60=240>>240 kernels pop.
In the final 26 seconds, 240 / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 kernels pop.
Thus, Amanda has 60 + 120 + 240 + 120 + 30 = <<60+120+240+120+30=570>>570 pieces of popcorn to eat.
#### 570"," The kernels pop 60 in the first 26 seconds.
In the next 26 seconds, they pop 2*60 = 120
In the 26 seconds after that, the rate is 4 * 60 = 240 times faster than the first 26 seconds.
The cumulative total after the second 26 seconds is 60 + 120 = 180.
