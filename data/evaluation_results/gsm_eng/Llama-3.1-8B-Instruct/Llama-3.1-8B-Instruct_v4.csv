1305,"The Smith family is busy making brownies. So far, they've made 7770 brownies. They have 2145 blueberry brownies, 2275 vanilla brownies, and some peanut butter brownies. How many peanut butter brownies have they made?","The total number of pieces of blueberry and vanilla brownies is 2145 + 2275 = <<2145+2275=4420>>4420.
Therefore, they made 7770 - 4420 = <<7770-4420=3350>>3350 peanut butter brownies.
#### 3350"," They've made a total of 7770 brownies so far
They've made 2145 blueberry and 2275 vanilla so 2145 + 2275 = 4420 vanilla and blueberry brownies 
They made 4420 blue and vanilla brownies and a total of 7770 so they must have made 7770 - 4420= 3350 more brownies
They must have made 3350 peanut butter

184,Ethan is rolling a 12-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 11 numbers greater than 1 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 11/12=91%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 91% - 25% = 66%.
#### 66"," Die has 12 sides so Ethan has a 1-11/12 chance to not roll a 1
There is an 11/12 chance that Ethan does not roll a 1. This also means there is an 11/12 chance he CAN roll a 1
It's equally likely that Ethan will roll any number on the 12 sided die, so there is 1/2 chance (6 numbers are odd, and 6/12#### 66626106605045054040403060404054040500404606406462360276252525253835305555253525560561266641005406050402342346214605565361645622545443050467546609054006045504497543023683645105537005510504035444336360000604355510555508166063058673655675123690552827783532755345755662256356735453045552525653050676555554254686733745545256604401256705663566044454796656542436421676545432000540000046486000026518745409555556632647555666564073806254754686495552558000564840333457355264712550023575826992957341505944863360000266602584064344775603378077554686060610554269350670465674502595603547550696508488442863536353376134196240744321332233637030000300043513366065413130314025704429161355160253156755333243368362549293702251049720250618625652499204135431650155355159150533137359344000004070551230331226279206175456138504935374655132132295164759470240849414550775326347331655811210851465045549457660475443021111364244618631688496451406737652860452137914825025724657696453179506635332987530754170217909253215494325060178422746135292406144045045692349746526550258762646390516563614766411232393191723745495227453565445533189494935644370263972523211552665124006074343331817537635270937741510712635",3.222334395046346,False
39,"Sophia can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends one quarter of the time running and three quarters of the time walking?","If Sophia can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 12/2=6 miles per hour.
If three quarters of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 4*3/4=<<4*3/4=3>>3 hours.
If one quarter of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-3=<<4-3=1>>1 hours.
Thus, she runs for 1 hours at 12 miles per hour, or 1*12=<<1*12=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 3 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 3*6=<<3*6=18>>18 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+18=<<12+18=30>>30 miles.
#### 30"," Sophia can skip at 6 miles per hour. Since she skips at a speed that is half of her running speed, her running speed must be 2
 times that. Therefore, she can run at 2 miles per hour.
 Sophia can run at 2 mph, so she can walk at 1 mph, because she can run 2 times faster than she can walk.

If each serving of breads has 325 calories and I only have 650 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 650/325 of a serving = 2 of a serving
We also know that a 300 oz bag of breads has 6 servings, hence each serving has 300 oz/6 = <<300/6=50>>50 ozs
If I can only eat 2 of a serving, then I can eat only 50 oz * 2 = 100 ozs
#### 100"," You have already eaten 1400 calories and need 2050 calories total so you need 2050-1400=<<2050-1400=650>>650 more calories
Since the amount of calries in one serving is the same as one oz (325 // !=6 servings), the amount of calries in one oz is 325/6=<<325/6=54.16666667>>54 calories.

Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 432 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<432/12=36>>36 foot.

From the economics and biology questions, she is sure to get one third of it correctly so that is 53 questions*1/3 = <<53*1/3=17>>17 points.
Thus, she is sure of getting 9 points + 17 points = <<9+17=26>>26 points in her quiz.
#### 26"," There are 120 items on the quiz and 55% are physics so 0.55*120= <<55*.01*120=66>>66 are physics.
There are 120 items and 66 are physics so 120-66=54 are not physics which are economics and biology.
There are 54 economics/biology questions and they are equaly divided so 54/2=27 each.

So in total, there are 88 + 88 = <<88+88=176>>176 cards of different colors.
#### 176"," The set has 32 blue cards and 75% more orange cards. That is 32 + (1 + 0.75)*32 = 32 + 1.75*32 = 32 + 56 = 88 orange cards.
The set has 32+ 88 = 120 purple cards.
The total number of cards is 120 orange + 88 blue + 120 purple = 328
