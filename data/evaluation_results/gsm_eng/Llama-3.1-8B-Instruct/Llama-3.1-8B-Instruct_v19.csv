All total he will eat 72+396 = <<72+396=468>>468 eggs
There are 12 eggs in 1 dozen and he will eat 468 eggs which is 468/12 = 39 dozen eggs
#### 39"," Jason eats 3 eggs a day for 24 days = 3 eggs/day * 24 days = 72 eggs.
Jason eats 6 eggs a day for 66 days = 6 eggs/day * 66 days = 396 eggs.
So, Jason needs 72 eggs + 396 eggs = 468 eggs.
Since a dozen is 12 eggs, Jason will need 468 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 39 dozen eggs.
The answer is 39

184,David is rolling a d20 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"There are 19 numbers greater than 1 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 19/20=95%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 95% - 25% = 70%.
#### 70"," The probability of him rolling a number greater than 1 is 19/20 since he can't roll a 1.

1084,"If Eric and Kenneth have 320 meters of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Kenneth getting 110 meters more than Eric, how much is left over for Eric?","Let x be the amount of fence Eric gets and y be the amount Kenneth gets. We know that y = x + 110, and y + x = 320.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+110=320
Subtracting the 110 from both sides, we get 2x=210
We divide each side by two, leaving x=105. This means Eric has 105 meters of fence left over.
#### 105"," Let Eric gets x meters of fence.
Since Kenneth gets 110 meters more than Eric, then Kenneth gets x + 110 meters of fence.
Total in x + 110 meters = 320 meters.
x + 110 = 320
x = 320 - 110
x = 210.

So it cost 24+4=£<<24+4=28>>28 per kg
He goes through 2*7=<<2*7=14>>14 kgs of sugar a week
So he paid 28.8*14=£<<28.8*14=403>>403 on sugar
That means his total bill was 403+5=£<<403+5=408>>408

and the more expensive sugar for the week is £168 * 1.2 = £201.6

Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 84 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<84/12=7>>7 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 7 foot / 70 feet * 100% = 10%

#### 10"," Each remora is 12 inches long, so 7 remoras * 12 inches / remora = 84 inches long.
To convert this to feet, 84 inches / 12 = 7 feet, so the combined length of the remoras is 7 feet.
The percentage is therefore 7 feet / 70 feet = 0.1, which means 10%.

Out of the 6 liters, 6*2/3 = <<6*2/3=4>>4 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 18 + 4 = <<18+4=22>>22 liters of water out of the 30 liters.
#### 22"," The 11 liters of apple juice are 2/3 water, or 2*11/3 = 22/3 liters water. However, on the way, 5 liters of the apple juice gets wasted, which means only 11-5 = sextants of juice from the apple juice were poured into the jug, which means 2/3 * 11-5 = 16/ 3 = 5.333 liters water is poured in the jug,####
