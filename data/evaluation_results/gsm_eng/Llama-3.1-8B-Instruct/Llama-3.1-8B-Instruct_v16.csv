How much money is Noah missing if he has €20 and the field trip costs €290?","Noah's school has decided to pay 290*3/5=€<<290*3/5=174>>174 for his field trip.
In total Noah has covered 174 + 20 = €<<174+20=194>>194 for his field trip
Therefore, Noah needs 290 - 194 = €<<290-194=96>>96 more for the field trip.
#### 96"," €20 + €20 * 3 / 5 = €20 + €12 = €32. Therefore, the school covers 320 euros.
Noah has 290 - 320 = -€30.
He is missing €30.
The answer is -30

The kernels increase to six times the initial popping rate in the next 30 seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds.

The rest of the trouts are 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5. He will earn 25*£1.25 = £<<25*1.25=31.25>>31.25 per each of them. So he will earn 5 * 31.25 = <<5*31.25>>=156.25
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is £82.5 + £51.25 + £156.25= £<<82.5+51.25+156.25=289>>290.

Therefore, Kenneth caught 107 + 125 = 232 kilograms of trouts.

And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 10/2=5 miles per hour.
If one quarter of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 4*1/4=<<4*1/4=1>>1 hours.
If three quarters of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours.
Thus, she runs for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, or 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 miles.
She walks for 1 hours at 5 miles per hour, or 1*5=<<1*5=5>>5 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 30+5=<<30+5=35>>35 miles.
#### 35"," She can run 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles per hour.
She can walk 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 miles per hour.
She can skip for 1 * 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 hours.
She can walk for 4 / 4 = <<4/4=1>>1 hour.
The distance she travels by running is 3/4 * 4 = <<3/4*4=3>>3 hours.
The total distance she travels is 6 * 4 = <<6*####

636,"Ella operates the cash register exactly four times as fast as her less-experienced colleague Madison. Daily, Madison processes 80 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?","While Madison is processing 80 orders in a day, Ella processes 80 orders/day*4=<<80*4=320>>320 orders/day.
In a day, they process 320 orders/day + 80 orders/day = <<320+80=400>>400 orders together.
The total number of orders the two processes in a week is 400 orders/day * 7 days/week = <<400*7=2800>>2800 orders
#### 2800"," Ella works 4*80=320 customers a day.
The total number of customers is 320+80 = <<320+80=400>>400 per day
If they work all week, which has 7 days, the total production is 400*7=2800 customers.
The answer is 2800. #### 2800",0.394283439964056,True
930,"When Lily watches her brother, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 49 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 49 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 23 multicolored rings on it. Lily recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her brother up to 208. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Lily has 49 + 49 + 23 + T = 121 + T = 208 toys for her brother.
Thus, T = 208 - 121 = <<208-121=87>>87 bouncy balls came in the tube.
#### 87","  There are 49 blocks, 49 stuffed animals and 23 bouncy balls which add up to 49 + 49 + 23 = 121 bouncy balls. She now has 208 bouncy balls in total and so the number of bouncy balls she bought recently is 208 - 121 = 87.
The answer is 87.
