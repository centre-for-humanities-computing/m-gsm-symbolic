1031,"Oakwood High School is holding graduation in their Convention Center this year which has space for 4400 people. After accounting for 250 seats for graduates and 450 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 250 + 450 = <<250+450=700>>700 seats for faculty and graduates
Minus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 4400 - 700 = <<4400-700=3700>>3700 remaining seats.
Divide remaining seats by the number of graduates. 3700/250 = <<3700/250=14>>14 tickets
#### 14"," The Convention Center is going to seat 4400 people - 250 people - 450 people = 3700 people.
Each graduate will receive 3700 people / 250 people/graduate = 14.8 people, but the answer can't be split so each graduate will receive 15 people tickets.

The number that like to hike is 155 total students - 135 that like to play video games - 3 that like to play running - 6 that like to bake = <<155-135-3-6=11>>11
#### 11"," 155 students - 135 students = 20 students, who either enjoy hiking or baking.
If the number that enjoy baking is twice the number that enjoy running, with 3 that enjoy running, 2*3=6 people enjoy baking.
So, 20 students - 6 students = 14 students like to hike.
The answer is 14.

How many bouncy balls came in the tube?","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Olivia has 46 + 32 + 29 + T = 107 + T = 157 toys for her cousin.

737,"Kenneth wants to make different sized ice cubes with 124 pounds of water. He can make giant cubes that use 6 pounds per cube, medium cubes that use 4 pounds, and small cubes that use 1/8 pound. If he makes 4 giant cubes, 10 medium cubes, and 24 small cubes, how many pounds of water does he have left?","The giant cubes used up 24 pounds of water because 4 times 6 equals <<4*6=24>>24.
The medium cubes used up 40 pounds of water because 10 times 4 equals <<10*4=40>>40.
The small cubes used up 3 pounds of water because 24 times 1/8 equals 3.
This means that Kenneth has used up 67 pounds of water because 24 plus 40 plus 3 equals 67.
Kenneth has 57 pounds of water left because 124 minus 67 equals <<124-67=57>>57.
#### 57"," Kenneth has used 4*6=24 pounds for giant cubes, 10*4=40 pounds for medium cubes, and 24/8*1=3 pounds for small cubes.
So in total, he has used 24+40+3=<<24+40+3=67>>67 pounds.
Thus, he has 124-67=<<124-67=57>>57 pounds of water left.

1026,One troll can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe and 55% more with a mithril pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 20 trolls with mithril pickaxes mine in a month with 29 days?,"First find how much ore a troll can mine with an bronze pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day
Then multiply that amount by 155% to find how much a troll can mine with a mithril pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 155% = <<10*155*.01=15>>15 pounds/day
Then multiply the amount one troll can mine in a day with a mithril pickaxe by the number of trolls: 15 pounds/day/troll * 20 trolls = <<15*20=310>>310 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 310 pounds/day * 29 days = <<310*29=8990>>8990 pounds/day
#### 8990"," One troll with a mithril pickaxe can mine 1 pound/(day*troll)*2 + (1 pound/(day*2trolls)*55/100 = 8.55 pounds/day/troll.
20 trolls with mithril pickaxes equal to 174 pounds/day mined.
In a 29 day month, that will be 174 pounds/day * 29 days = <<174*29= 5 046>> 5,046 pounds.

718,"260 people apply for a job at Netflix. Of the people that apply, only 23% receive interviews. Of those who receive interviews, 21% receive a job offer. Of those who receive a job offer, one fifth of the people accept the position. How many people accept the position?","The number of people that receive interviews is 260 * 0.23 = <<260*0.23=59>>59 people
The number of people that receive a job offer is 59 * 0.21 = <<59*0.21=12>>12 people
The number of people that accept the position is 12*1/5 = <<12*1/5=2>>2 people
#### 2"," 260 people * 23% = 0.23 * 260 = <<260*23*.01=59.8>>59.8 people receive interviews.
