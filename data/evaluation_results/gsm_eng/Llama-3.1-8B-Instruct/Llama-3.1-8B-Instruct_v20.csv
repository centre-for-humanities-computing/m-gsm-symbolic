On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 6% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the apartment than Mrs. Smith's budget?","The brokerage fee is $440,000*6/100 = $<<440,000*6/100=26,400>>26,400.

The total price of the apartment is $440,000 + $26,400 + $52,800 = $519,200.
So, it is $519,200 - $460,000 = $<<519,200-460,000=59,200>>59,200 more than Mrs. Smith's budget.

Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 120 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<120/12=10>>10 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 10 foot / 250 feet * 100% = 4%

#### 4"," The length of all the remoras = 3*40*12= <<3*40*12=1440>>1440 inches or 12*1440/12=<<1440/12=120>>120 feet

 Anna saw a 250-foot dolphin with 3 40-inch remoras attached to it. The length of all the remoras = 3*40*12= <<3*40*12=1440>>1440 inches or 12*1440/12=<<1440/12=120>>120 feet  .

991,Comet Encke orbits the sun every 65 years. Michael's grandfather saw the Comet when he was 25 years old. Michael saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his grandfather was when he saw the Comet. How old was Michael when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"Michael saw the Comet for the second time when he was 25 years * 3= <<25*3=75>>75 years old.
Comet Encke can be seen every 65 years, so Michael saw the comet for the first time when he was 75 years - 65 years = <<75-65=10>>10 years old.
#### 10"," The comet orbits 1 cycle every 65 years, so 1 orbit is 65 years, at the time Michael and his grandfather saw it both, Michael's grandfather was 25
Michael's grandfather was 25+65=<<25+65=90>>90 when he was the first person to see it, as he did not know it had been seen before by the first person

1207,"Ethan caught 5 steelheads last Saturday, the first steelhead he caught weighs 48 kilograms, the second steelhead he caught weighs 30 kilograms, and the remaining steelhead he caught weighs 30 kilograms. If a kilogram of steelhead costs €1.75, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?","Ethan will earn 48*€1.75 = €<<48*1.75=84>>84 from the first steelhead.
He will earn 30*€1.75 = €<<30*1.75=52.5>>52.5 for the second steelhead.
The rest of the steelheads are 5-2 = <<5-2=3>>3. He will earn 30*€1.75 = €<<30*1.75=52.5>>52.5 per each of them. So he will earn 3 * 52.5 = <<3*52.5>>=157.5
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the steelheads is €84 + €52.5 + €157.5= €<<84+52.5+157.5=293>>294.
#### 294"," The fourth and fifth steelhead weigh 30+30=60 kilograms
The first and fifth steelhead weigh 48+60 = 108 kilograms
The second and fourth steelhead weigh 30+30 = 60 kilograms.
The total weith of the steelhead is 108 + 60 = 168 kilograms.
And the amount he is going to earn is 168 * 1.75 = 294.

242,Oliver was a pen pal with 13 people. He stopped being penpals with 2 of them. They each send 3 letters a week that are 6 pages long. He responds in kind. He can write a page every 10 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week?,"Oliver is penpals with 13-2=<<13-2=11>>11 people
Thus he gets 11*3=<<11*3=33>>33 letters a week
So he writes 33*6=<<33*6=198>>198 pages a week
So he writes for 198*10=<<198*10=1980>>1980 minutes a week
So he writes 1980/60=<<1980/60=33>>33 hours a week
#### 33"," He was pen pals with 13 people - 2 people = <<13-2=11>>11 people.
A week he writes  11 people * 3 letters * 7 days * 6 pages per letter =  1386 pages.
A week he spends 1386 pages * 10 minutes/page = 13860 minutes writing.
The number of hours is 13860/60 = 231.
The answer is 231.

Find the combined total of the number of bananas and corns Joe has in the house?","Before buying any banana and corn, Joe had thrice as many bananas as corns, which is 84 corns*3 banana/corn = <<84*3=252>>252 bananas
The total number of bananas and corns that Joe had before is 252 bananas + 84 corns = <<252+84=336>>336 items
When he bought 19 fewer bananas than corns, he bought 35 bananas - 19 bananas = <<35-19=16>>16 bananas
In total, he bought 16 bananas + 35 corns = <<16+35=51>>51 items
After the purchases, Joe has 336 items + 51 items = <<336+51=387>>387 total bananas and corns combined.
#### 387"," he has 84/3 = 28 bananas 
he has 84+35=<<84+35=119>>119 corns after shop
he has 119-19 = <<119-19=100>>100 bananas after mathcing the number to pasessed corns bananas and replacing corns.
The total of corns and bananas 119+100=<<119+100=219>>219
