1084,"If Eric and Joe have 240 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Joe getting 190 feet more than Eric, how much is left over for Eric?","Let x be the amount of fence Eric gets and y be the amount Joe gets. We know that y = x + 190, and y + x = 240.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+190=240
Subtracting the 190 from both sides, we get 2x=50
We divide each side by two, leaving x=25. This means Eric has 25 feet of fence left over.
#### 25"," If Eric gets 50 feet of fence and Joe gets 190 feet, that is a total of 50 + 190 = <<50+190=240>>240 feet
240 = <<240=240>>240
Since they will use up all the fence, this will leave 0 feet left over.
The answer is 0.

Then find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 300 yards / 75 yards/minute = <<300/75=4>>4 minutes
Then subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 6 minutes - 4 minutes = <<6-4=2>>2 minutes

#### 5"," The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3*5*1=15 dollars.

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?","If Sophia can skip at one third the speed she can run, then she can run at 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is thrice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/3=2 miles per hour.
If two thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*2/3=<<6*2/3=4>>4 hours.
If one third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 2 miles per hour, or 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 miles.

Then multiply that amount by 160% to find how much a miner can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 160% = <<10*160*.01=16>>16 pounds/day
Then multiply the amount one miner can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of miners: 16 pounds/day/miner * 21 miners = <<16*21=336>>336 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 336 pounds/day * 28 days = <<336*28=9408>>9408 pounds/day
#### 9408"," One man uses a bronze pickaxe and mines 1.6 * 5 = 8 pounds of ore per day

The total number of pears and oranges that Kenneth had before is 58 pears + 29 oranges = <<58+29=87>>87 items
When he bought 43 fewer pears than oranges, he bought 78 pears - 43 pears = <<78-43=35>>35 pears
In total, he bought 35 pears + 78 oranges = <<35+78=113>>113 items
After the purchases, Kenneth has 87 items + 113 items = <<87+113=200>>200 total pears and oranges combined.
#### 200"," To start there are 2 times as many pears as oranges so 2x= 29 x 2 = <<2*29=58>>58 pears
Then he bought 78 more oranges so there are 29 + 78 = <<29+78=107>>107 oranges
He also bought fewer peaches, 43 fewer, so he bought 107-43=<<107-43=64>>64 peaches
Together they now have 64 + 107 = <<64+107=171>>#### 1712275047815595702460716707517115770757371575388752272366668865448811874117644542788019010940717660494116875774424757513174141941165718723074948513343511144674494778327793750311133154671152557181688646475011412214617432231525637161119675441790325154743499511301180711714332470144299557155331105572527532994143929315676097627939548572874039964693023724998783634421355488075951173246351511455698712233446053948617353528127638311554265447325516588747450816513465323176490941815679636822619946785982839985444927449735720767917455255575211314430361583234384627922317458293357330562596768283396151298279557224698721415416676973712612333508094745271864541417904728845304727347453139177446931454838474346612754156775852727365165572051076762667864485357633842374698611514749527364541999849391193589342736622585533917513971384665696670681546387993831563588547548491768122760354652813910135273466167712227744992464134326215519853721964677634873966196987493666627439525109138397673513472366739746719606446656543557598451199377613115701693130984696613475651669333667166766611466677665279655232891397913161112265536834338191399621942036465935173987537056711",3.2748968719970435,False

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 10% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the townhouse than Dr. Patel's budget?","The brokerage fee is $420,000*3/100 = $<<420,000*3/100=12,600>>12,600.
The transfer fee is $420,000*10/100 = $<<420,000*10/100=42,000>>42,000.
The total price of the townhouse is $420,000 + $12,600 + $42,000 = $474,600.

#### 4600"," First, calculate the brokerage fee as a decimal: 3% = 0.03
Now multiply the selling price by the brokerage fee to get the total dollar amount: $420,000 * 0.03 = $12,600
Do the same for the transfer fee: 10% = 0.1
$420,000 * 0.1 = $42,000
Add both fee amounts together: $42,000 + $12,600 = $54,600

1275,"Joshua's van breaks down. The van weighs 1700 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 425 pounds. He also has his four young children who weigh 85 pounds each in it. If the force to move the van is 1% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the van?","His four children weigh 85*4=<<85*4=340>>340 pounds
So the total weight of the van and everything is 1700+425+340=<<1700+425+340=2465>>2465 pounds
So he needs to generate 2465*0.01=<<2465*0.01=24>>24 pounds
#### 24"," The weight of the van is 1682 pounds
So moving the van will require 1/100*1682=16.8 pounds of force
Joshua and the kids in it weigh a total of 425 + 85*4 = <<425+340=765>>765
Factor that in and it will take  1/100(765+1682) = 17.7
