788,"Alex is raising money for a science fair. He has applied for help from the community center, which has decided to cover one fifth of the cost of the science fair. How much money is Alex missing if he has $130 and the science fair costs $880?","Alex's community center has decided to pay 880*1/5=$<<880*1/5=176>>176 for his science fair.
In total Alex has covered 176 + 130 = $<<176+130=306>>306 for his science fair
Therefore, Alex needs 880 - 306 = $<<880-306=574>>574 more for the science fair.
#### 574"," One fifth of the cost is $880 / 5 = $<<880/5=176>>176
He's still $880 - $176 = $<<704=704>>704 away from his goal
He's missing 704 - 130 = $<<704-130=574>>574

1026,One gnome can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a silver pickaxe and 35% more with a titanium pickaxe than with a silver pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 22 gnomes with titanium pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?,"First find how much ore a gnome can mine with an silver pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day
Then multiply that amount by 135% to find how much a gnome can mine with a titanium pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 135% = <<10*135*.01=13>>13 pounds/day
Then multiply the amount one gnome can mine in a day with a titanium pickaxe by the number of gnomes: 13 pounds/day/gnome * 22 gnomes = <<13*22=297>>297 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 297 pounds/day * 30 days = <<297*30=8910>>8910 pounds/day
#### 8910"," The amount of ore one gnome can mine with a titanium pickaxe is 1.35 * 10 = 13.5 pounds because 10 = 5 * 2, and 5 * 2 * 1.35 = 13.5
The amount of ore 22 gnomes can mine in a month is 13.5 * 30 * 22 = 9,630

Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the steelheads is $162 + $74.25 + $229.5= $<<162+74.25+229.5=465>>465.

Carl saw the comet a second time when he was two times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Carl when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"Carl saw the Comet for the second time when he was 39 years * 2= <<39*2=78>>78 years old.
Comet Hale-Bopp can be seen every 55 years, so Carl saw the comet for the first time when he was 78 years - 55 years = <<78-55=23>>23 years old.
#### 23"," Let x be Carl's age the first time he saw the comet.
This means x/2 + 39 was his age the second time.
Since x/2 + 39 = x + 2, we solve for x, so x/2 = x + 2 - 39
x/2 = x - 37
Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us  x = 2x - 74
So x - 2x = -74: -x = -74
Divide both sides by -1: x = 74
So Carl was 74.

1084,"If Abby and Olivia have 280 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Olivia getting 150 yards more than Abby, how much is left over for Abby?","Let x be the amount of fence Abby gets and y be the amount Olivia gets. We know that y = x + 150, and y + x = 280.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+150=280
Subtracting the 150 from both sides, we get 2x=130
We divide each side by two, leaving x=65. This means Abby has 65 yards of fence left over.
#### 65"," If we denote the yards of Abby as x, then Olivia has x+150 yards of fence.
The sum of the yards of their fence should be 280 yards.
Thus h(x) x + x + 150 = 280
Combine like terms g(x) 2x + 150 = 280
Subtract 150 from both sides of the equation f (x) 2x = 130

Find the combined total of the number of apples and bananas Ethan has in the house?","Before buying any apple and banana, Ethan had five times as many apples as bananas, which is 54 bananas*5 apple/banana = <<54*5=270>>270 apples
The total number of apples and bananas that Ethan had before is 270 apples + 54 bananas = <<270+54=324>>324 items

After buying the cookies, he was left with 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 cents so he spent 60 cents of £1 on cookies
If 1 bag of cookies cost him 60 cents, the amount he paid for cookies is 40 / 60 * 100 = 66.67% his total money.

So far, this is a total of 130 + 13 = <<130+13=143>>143 letters.
Writing this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 143 * 2 = <<143*2=286>>286 letters.
#### 286"," First determine how many letters Andrea writes by re-writing the alphabet 5 times because that's the most we know: 26*5 = 130. Add the number of letters from the next re-write, but since only half of all the new letters have been written, 130/2 = 13. Or 130+13 = 143.

On the sidewalk, Jessica walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 28-feet walk, in minutes?","On the beach, Jessica walks at a rate of 15 feets per 60 minutes, or 15/60 = 1/4 feets per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/4 = 0.5 feets per minute.
To walk 13 feet(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 13/0.5 = <<13/0.5=26>>26 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Jessica 60+26 = <<60+26=86>>86 minutes to walk her favorite route.
#### 86"," First find Jessica's speed on the beach: 15 feets / 60 minutes = 0.25 feets/minute
Because she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk as on the beach, the speed on the sidewalk will be 0.25 x 2 = 0.5 feets/minute.
The total time spent walking on the sidewalk can be found by dividing the distance (13) #### 002500428578686576866468260415429525526131025419990299890349002736210022660343691029422296011431280056370430076733742961621101606232312200028247554918079628156075960922371672772005696202569602450864865752495874172606236762480068940257258198486269223982828624430296430989725891901327550292879045343457489023860074197621232625157168325420792125596668650367157712693748133356778115292597390216031183964425115957817970540071162969888682092313236763690068322284461827452921773915826022550279519864070299936584283533722160782325567944592422196810592692503595968819029760209521963744996139666720810811983534335472631373931013839617107938232722547512861262876166316350649807026610771396946787110102929804156961080488621999541621472165921068644902294863640884099231487206007756076751428375975906393402740269447831395203506715550118100210201155305692242403497899519991251097463130003683301300264659295342210113079806725964917131400001258788774124770000768103521568310375232312082576977639106669235635217862442687137711275420106216065601672165346171877911979353585041717218764665687876635286177319958270815182384374280834171119454463450050524112060852384257107329955996883428395613912835812966793210571314312848411932711478402401",2.9560579659882933,False

39,"Olivia can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is two thirds as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 4 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking?","If Olivia can skip at two thirds the speed she can run, then she can run at 4*3/2=<<4*3/2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/2=3 miles per hour.
If half of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 4*1/2=<<4*1/2=2>>2 hours.
If half of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
