873,Chris has €80.5517098445596 and wants to buy 15 washers from a bin at the hardware store. Each washer costs €0.98. How much money does Chris have left after paying for the washers?,"Chris paid 15 * €0.98 = €<<15*0.98=14.7>>14.7 for the washers.
Chris has €80.5517098445596 - €14.7 = €65 left.

How many like to bake if the number that like to play video games is twice the number that prefer playing basketball?","The number of students that like to play video games is twice as many as the number who like basketball, so 2 * 32 = <<2*32=64>>64
The number that like to bake is 157 total students - 4 that like to read - 32 that like to play basketball - 64 that like to play video games = <<157-4-32-64=57>>57

473,Madison saw a 200-foot dolphin with 6 20-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 20 inches/remora * 6 remoras = <<20*6=120>>120 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 120 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<120/12=10>>10 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 10 foot / 200 feet * 100% = 5%

#### 5"," The remoras' length together is 120 feet because 6 * 20 = <<6*20=120>>120
The percentage of the dolphin's body that is remoras is 0.6, or 60, because 120/200 = 60/100 = 0.6

1264,"Eric is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 20 pop in the first 20 seconds of cooking, then four times that amount in the next 20 seconds. The kernels increase to six times the initial popping rate in the next 20 seconds, but in the final 20 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 20 seconds. After Eric takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 20 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Eric have to eat?","In the second 20 seconds of cooking, 4*20=<<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.
In the third 20 seconds, 6*20=<<6*20=120>>120 kernels pop.
In the final 20 seconds, 120 / 2 = <<120/2=60>>60 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 kernels pop.
Thus, Eric has 20 + 80 + 120 + 60 + 15 = <<20+80+120+60+15=295>>295 pieces of popcorn to eat.
#### 295"," The popcorn pops 20 in the first 20 seconds.
20, then 20*4=80 in the next 20 seconds.

Then multiply that amount by 160% to find how much a gnome can mine with a mithril pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 160% = <<10*160*.01=16>>16 pounds/day
Then multiply the amount one gnome can mine in a day with a mithril pickaxe by the number of gnomes: 16 pounds/day/gnome * 20 gnomes = <<16*20=320>>320 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 320 pounds/day * 28 days = <<320*28=8960>>8960 pounds/day
#### 8960"," The mithril pickaxe picks 1.6 times as much as the silver pickaxe because .6 * 2 = <<.6*2=1.2>>1.2, but since you're going 60% more than 2 times, you go from 2 to 2 + (2 * .6) = 2* 1.6 = 3.2 times as much as the wooden pick axe

125,"Amanda was preparing for a birthday party at her house, where she intended to serve roast chicken. She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 18 new forks and gave them to Amanda. While Amanda was making the roast chicken, she used three of the forks to sample her roast chicken. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 17 forks. How many forks were in the package that Amanda bought?","The total number of forks from Amanda and her husband was 17+3=<<17+3=20>>20 forks.
Since the husband bought a package of 18 forks, then Amanda's package contained 20-18=<<20-18=2>>2 forks.
#### 2"," Amanda has 17-18+3=2 forks in her house
So she bought 3 other forks (3 - 2 = 1) and that package cost 3
The answer is 3.

The correct solution is through logic:
Joe has enough money for 95/310 of the conference because 95 / 310= <<95/310=0.3065>> .3065 or approximately 31% of the conference

1223,"To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay €0.75 for each minute of your call. After 18 minutes, that price drops to €0.5 per minute. How much would a 85-minute call cost?","First 18 minutes would be a cost of 18 * 0.75 = €<<18*0.75=13>>13.
After that, there are 85 - 18 = <<85-18=67>>67 minutes of the call left.
And these 67 minutes cost 67 * 0.5 = €<<67*0.5=33>>33.
So in total, the 85-minute call would cost 13 + 33 = €46.
#### 47"," The call for the first 18 minutes cost .75*18= <<.75*18=13.50>> 13.50 euros
The call for the rest of the time cost .50*(85-18)=.50*67=<<.50*67=33.50>>33.50 euros
The call will cost 13.50+33.50=<<13.50+33.50=47>>47 euros

655,Sophia is required to submit a 96-page assignment. She already finished writing 1/12 of the assignment. How many pages does she have left to write?,"Sophia has already written 1/12 of the assignment which is 96 pages*1/12 = <<96*1/12=8>>8 pages.
So, she still needs to write 96 pages - 8 pages = <<96-8=88>>88 pages.
#### 88"," Sophia has 96 / 12 = <<96/12=8>>8 pages written.
8 pages is 8 / 96 = 1/12 of her assignment.
So Sophia has 1 - 1/12s = 11/12s left to write.
To convert 11/12s to a decimal, divide the numerator by denominator.
11/12 = 0.9167
8.5 pages are in 0.9167 because 96 / 11 = <<96/11=8.727>>8.727
0.2737 is 8#### 131205699507241329332661445978128470536977733518951351069147461071851574993226514390922234517251231100954114564240053211122431675591765280235980315411835419445228599554204453934354722975338964681557575532160115153888333529293222033085555221567281257965056284330216424616533555608322103015756565599331379393190460599629285655448340231551815127562553361364478940377166414771642411677411631223459132411454662335246703424021524971885131322134141434119355666646333770776013351556155476759433538178968117935514445433313383975388742550256446126356758411121321313055411949974455322517464121475661332481406007413295392355645716643661461324577125383041273237045626355343144455555313225619345633235232453224511333616776011016897076357321434623116348557580366267753722011535396174735595584351486164644825566635422331652524426353333115356511333380227651217362153135355425333013644446116113221545667342213304665654383443455744612315623113221454102444693255611626366311164027244655623066331453332243435660145645511335613831656415266161233173554325133961348558115455667545545445234524337566166333515651654654511466555415535113",3.3994406850542873,False
