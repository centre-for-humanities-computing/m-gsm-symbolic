661,Carl goes to the store to buy some sugar. The normal brand of sugar he buys costs $7 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 10% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses 1 kg of sugar per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for $5. How much did everything cost?,"The sugar he bought was 7*0.1=$<<7*0.1=0>>0 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys
So it cost 7+0=$<<7+0=7>>7 per kg
He goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kgs of sugar a week
So he paid 7.7*7=$<<7.7*7=53>>53 on sugar
That means his total bill was 53+5=$<<53+5=58>>58
#### 58"," The second brand is 7*.1 = 0.7 dollars more expensive each kg
The second brand is $7+$0.7 = $<<7+0.7=7.7>>7.7 per kg
This means that Carl paid 7.7 - 7 = 0.7 dollars more for each kg over his first choice
Since he needs a week (7 days) supply of sugar he needs 7 kg of the first brand or the second

Then find how many batches of onions she needs to cook: 70 onions / 35 onions/batch = <<70/35=2>>2 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 2 batches * 12 minutes/batch = <<2*12=24>>24 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Ava spends: 24 minutes + 7 minutes = <<24+7=31>>31 minutes

There are 41-7-14 = <<41-7-14=20>>20 white cubes in the pyramid.

Since the pyramid is 7 * 2 = 14 cubes of green, we can add these together with the black and white to get 14+7+x. This equals 41 cubes total.
Combining the left side, we get x+21=41.
To solve for x, we subtract 21 from both sides to find x equals 20.

459,"A farmer is buying feed for his sheep. He buys a variety of wheats, apples, cucumbers and corns. Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 8-pound bags. Wheats are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys thirty-six 60-pound packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the wheats, so he buys eighteen 60-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1650 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 4*3 = <<4*3=12>>12 pounds of corns.
He is buying 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 pounds of cucumbers.

He is buying 36*60 = <<36*60=2160>>2160 pounds of wheats.
The weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 1080 + 2160 = <<12+48+1080+2160=3300>>3300 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 3300 / 1650 = <<3300/1650=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.

11,"Ava went to the cafe and bought various types of desserts. She bought 3 dozen donuts which cost $17 per dozen, 5 dozen tarts which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen mini cheesecakes for $116 per dozen. How much was the total cost?","The total charge for the donuts was 3*$17 = $<<3*17=51>>51.
The total charge for the tarts was 5*$77 = $<<5*77=385>>385.
The total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 3*$116 = $<<3*116=348>>348.
Therefore the total amount Ava paid for the desserts was $51 + $385 + $348 = $<<51+385+348=784>>784.

1247,"Bob has a bag of buttons with 38 inside. He tripped over a rock while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 12. When he went back home, he inspected the buttons further. Four of the ones he picked up weren't buttons, but actually coins so he got rid of them. How many buttons did Bob end up with?","Bob dropped his buttons and was left with 38*1/2=<<38*1/2=19>>19 buttons.
He searched and found some of his lost buttons, getting him back to 19+12=<<19+12=31>>31 buttons.
He went home and removed four coins, leaving him with 31-4=<<31-4=27>>27 buttons.
#### 27"," First, we establish that Bob dropped 38/2 = 19 buttons.
Since he found 12, that means he had lost or removed 19-12 = 7 buttons.
He found some things which were not buttons and got rid of them but we want button quantities, so the coins are irrelevant. He still has the other 5 that he didn't pick up#### 5",0.7863842970691621,False
