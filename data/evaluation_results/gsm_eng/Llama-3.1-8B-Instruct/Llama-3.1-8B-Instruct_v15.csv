364,"There are 89 first-graders at Oak Ridge School. 63 of them are girls. On Thursday, 7 first-grade girls and 6 first-grade boys were absent. How many first grade boys were at Oak Ridge School on Thursday?","Of the 89 first graders, 63 are girls, so 89 students - 63 girls = <<89-63=26>>26 boys.
On Thursday there were 26 boys - 6 absent = <<26-6=20>>20 boys.
#### 20"," First find the total number of students that were absent, which is 7 + 6 = <<7+6=13>>13.
This means there were 89 - 13 = <<89-13=76>>76 students present
Since 63 out of 89 students were girls, this means 89 - 63 = 26 students were boys.
This means there were 26 - 6 = <<26-6=20>>20 boys at school on#### 203919141934434493838494893943134638340293602442180939840142013232448035449702891843112129382898434809394039394094998381421934239046983494017182731434639145910810638223434839108641899184912468934948432812319440811818793489178198331641696172133676743948429317498436121918272718283418138903818193918793730639742814934307834371081819819327614461977353814470314481679114411112666410019743814023428447114815165333716463184119511723867517717719713404541949754327368391616953790489710536889097333685129679689355143528381689837386749829473428913328277893871911818171785193421811811110111111908093139911821218149399183219410440129383346354214442619669911513732160931233318642814911343115181611874547411343413261181181181734073802181114689111371113933984840333097352124713113279405826992957344895944863339411766621284011178147733133721374611113736161012126935061146567419136860329724411761212384428927371533761341962980718213322336233196003058551133718111131683140257104291613141602531135987332571683911492937147331497168135186256166992041354316501718551591505331373593440313142414512434312435792061754843385049353746551321171951647594834571698414731511326718331760558112108514117117494134118",5.157409950043075,False
125,"Ashley was preparing for a birthday party at her house, where she intended to serve beef stew. She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.

If the force to move the car is 1% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the car?","His four colleagues weigh 75*4=<<75*4=300>>300 kilograms
So the total weight of the car and everything is 2500+375+300=<<2500+375+300=3175>>3175 kilograms
So he needs to generate 3175*0.01=<<3175*0.01=31>>31 kilograms
#### 31"," Oliver's four young colleagues weigh 300 kg because 75*4 = <<75*4=300>>300
All the people as well as the furniture and car together weigh 4100 kg because 2500 + 375 + 300 = 4100
He needs to push the car for 1% of its total weight which is 41 kg because 4100 * 1/100 = 41

1026,One gnome can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with basic shovel. He can mine twice as much with a nickel pickaxe and 35% more with a titanium pickaxe than with a nickel pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 24 gnomes with titanium pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?,"First find how much ore a gnome can mine with an nickel pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day
Then multiply that amount by 135% to find how much a gnome can mine with a titanium pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 135% = <<10*135*.01=13>>13 pounds/day
Then multiply the amount one gnome can mine in a day with a titanium pickaxe by the number of gnomes: 13 pounds/day/gnome * 24 gnomes = <<13*24=324>>324 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 324 pounds/day * 28 days = <<324*28=9072>>9072 pounds/day
#### 9072"," A gnome with a nickel pickaxe can mine 10 pounds of ore per day because 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10

Oliver = 3/5*355 + 46 = 259 points
355 + 259 = <<355+259=614>>614 points
Together, Jessica and Oliver scored 614 points.
#### 614"," To begin, we need to calculate the points that Jessica had 3/5 of: 355 points * 3/5 = 213 points.
Jessica had 46 points more of three fifths as many points as Jessica. This means that Oliver had a total of 213 + 46 points. 213 + 46 = 259.

If each serving of breads has 200 calories and I only have 800 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 800/200 of a serving = 4 of a serving
We also know that a 100 grams bag of breads has 5 servings, hence each serving has 100 grams/5 = <<100/5=20>>20 gramss

184,Ethan is rolling a d6 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 4 numbers greater than 2 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 4/6=66%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 66% - 25% = 41%.
#### 41"," Since a d6 die has the following numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6, there are 5 results greater than 2 because there are 5 options after 2 (3,4,5,6, out of  6 options in total 1,2,3,4,5,6) so the probability that he rolls a number greater than 2 is 5/6 or 83.33%.
To start, let's list out the odd numbers:1,3,5. ####

If his farm truck can carry 2100 poundss at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 poundss of apples.
He is buying 4*8 = <<4*8=32>>32 poundss of carrots.
He is buying 20*50 = <<20*50=1000>>1000 poundss of hay.
He is buying 42*75 = <<42*75=3150>>3150 poundss of wheats.
The weight of all the feed is 18 + 32 + 1000 + 3150 = <<18+32+1000+3150=4200>>4200 poundss.
Thus, the farmer needs 4200 / 2100 = <<4200/2100=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.
#### 2"," The number of pounds of apples is 6 boxes * 3 pounds/box = <<6*3=18>>18 pounds.
The number of pounds of carrots is 4 bags * 8 pounds/bag = <<4*8=32>>32 pounds.
The number of pounds of wheat is 42 packs * 75 pounds/pack = <<42*75=3150>>3150 pounds.
The number of pounds of hay is 20 sacks * 50 pounds#### 2188121721671871385713736271132908174978579292932143201840101721731653127279382211321721681277320173921038725704218562653108109557540720128016892061279107296855575567350984921110169973971032336134573976670864584521137168189277239196628591463764673421621224511111646447146452197779227216927529382674119933022143654515574435233467109285770382610244615600161191138119210734189154175135476122385576475593976453976272344562813432515051718416622532142155154178551798557268737864743163171777038164517162141431592532358640876638592010153299966846518410567197003714297514437525325663425776161479215672204698134371875510960785622704187369517746958356774056848523762329525619561886141299886412411827484254111322366164014316110171866727837887224111435830229385521846912373248025083174375811189854681428004725489584361543261444995174505847166245543955523524192314736356654621555375041361546218188349395145697475699676687492942567536177173767333177268231397661233550384982670775110224712537546334737323429635634239773256435145873523651227057410163531115718395145493367473855343693333955735975679651246196767691167166131656411467765556897512351583583151135455111403163667515152337421571115032453404",3.1264803369995207,False

#### 277"," The fog bank covers the city at a rate of 63 miles per 277 minutes. To find the rate at which it covers the city, we divide 277 minutes by 63 miles. 277 / 63 = <<277/63=4.397>>4.397.
This is the rate in minutes per mile. The city is 97 miles across. 97 * 4.397 = 427.649 or 428 minutes, after we set#### 42976986862323123123123123123123123131231231231231237112754201062160656016501650165016501865016516501650146501665016501650106501650111650118216037428012617111906463450050524050060064556257107017017017617461395613912835812357932105710503121070170177111061061067193466156936612215989784321241001013409410065691069596959665632630703175351010140144355930954976112297141111170215423006624061741044686010154390430350206521426051324930097041130360570131805930405829927449105140117250093141311610570109110550650070967713810451111141305964751251832755346157459864611410042867653768339111061371415101302102231558154010717611001565006506221260421067014245144101301717614624084006630127656105115593155011005030054277108041361365959972360210301027170166376106060210215109330705057710660070202415180330051027549556590151551442045429970174567516130127210610683921216565420150016630105826330650224637680171542661034505046443712755150147417531408192046459025145111252226991112204654118067437360051017673462076312057525303211116130616154075913917075092462390415672721350320351023270467110117537632571210011928457020115377182125074562505102301241025570590064051531413017277177860801366122856512456131",2.996105181053281,False
