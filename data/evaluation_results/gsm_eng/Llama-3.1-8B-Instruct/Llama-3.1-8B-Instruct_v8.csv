Red cards make up to 53 + 65 = <<53+65=118>>118 cards.
So in total, there are 118 + 118 = <<118+118=236>>236 cards of different colors.
#### 236","  HA Expertise Suicide Rate  plus purple cards, that is equals 24% of purple card + (70 cards, 24 %--0 24 %77.
Number of orange cards as red cards as purple plus orange = (53  -37692%.72 ≈ 53 = 76

Total number of cards = 53 + 76 + 70 = 199
The final answer is: 199

1207,"Carl caught 7 trouts last Wednesday, the first trout he caught weighs 76 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 32 kilograms, and the remaining trout he caught weighs 27 kilograms. If a kilogram of trout costs £2.5, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?","Carl will earn 76*£2.5 = £<<76*2.5=190>>190 from the first trout.
He will earn 32*£2.5 = £<<32*2.5=80>>80 for the second trout.
The rest of the trouts are 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5. He will earn 27*£2.5 = £<<27*2.5=67.5>>67.5 per each of them. So he will earn 5 * 67.5 = <<5*67.5>>=337.5
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is £190 + £80 + £337.5= £<<190+80+337.5=607>>607.
#### 607"," The 7 trouts weigh 7 * (76+32+27) =  7 * 135 = 945 kilograms.
Carl can sell his 945 kilograms of trout and collect 945*2.5 = 2362.5 pounds.

473,Ethan saw a 150-foot shark with 3 12-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 12 inches/remora * 3 remoras = <<12*3=36>>36 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 36 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<36/12=3>>3 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 3 foot / 150 feet * 100% = 2%

#### 2"," The remoras are a total 36 inches long, or 3 feet, because 3*12 = 36

164,"Emily is trying to decide whether to do her financial planning herself or hire one tax consultant. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 5 fewer hours of contract work, losing £48/hour in missed income. The tax consultant charges £53. How much more money will she have if she hires the tax consultant?","First find the total lost revenue if Emily does her financial planning herself: £48/hour * 5 hours = £<<48*5=240>>240
Then subtract the tax consultant's charge to find how much money Emily saves: £240 - £53 = £<<240-53=187>>187
#### 187"," Emily will make £240 less because 5*48 = <<5*48=240>>240
Hiring the tax consultant will cost £53
But she will be £187 better off overall because 240 - 53 = 187
