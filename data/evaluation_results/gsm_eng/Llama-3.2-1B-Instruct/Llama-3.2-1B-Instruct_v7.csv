336,"Laura buys 7 shares of a stock for €81 each. The stock price increases 40% the first year Laura holds it, then decreases 15% in the second year. What is the final value of all Laura's shares?","First find the initial total value of Laura's purchase: 7 shares * €81/share = €<<7*81=567>>567
Then find the amount of the first price increase: €567 * 0.4 = €<<567*0.4=226.8>>226
Add that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: €567 + €226.8 = €<<567+226.8=793.8>>793
Then multiply that amount by 15% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: €793.8 * 15% = €<<793.8*15*.01=119.07>>119
Then subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: €793 - €119 = €<<793-119=674>>674
#### 674"," So Laura starts with 7*81=<<7*81=567>>567
After one year, 567*1.4=<<567*1.4=793>>793 dollars.
She holds the stock for two years and this goes up to 793*1.15=<<793*1.15=911>>911 dollars
So Laura has a final value of 911 dollars.

She already has 10 potted plants on each of the 59 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 3 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Jessica remain with?","Two days ago, before receiving the plants, Jessica had 10*59 = <<10*59=590>>590 potted plants
After receiving an additional 26 plants, she therefore had a total of 590 + 26 = <<590+26=616>>616 potted plants
Tomorrow, Jessicas plant giveaway will be 59*3 = <<59*3=177>>177 potted plants.
She will therefore remain with 616 - 177 = <<616-177=439>>439 potted plants.
