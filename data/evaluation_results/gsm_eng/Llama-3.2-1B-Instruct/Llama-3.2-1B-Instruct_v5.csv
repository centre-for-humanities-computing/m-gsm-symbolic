If a kilogram of tune costs $1.0, how much will he earn after selling all the tunes to the market?","Henry will earn 64*$1 = $<<64*1=64>>64 from the first tune.
He will earn 41*$1 = $<<41*1=41>>41 for the second tune.
The rest of the tunes are 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5. He will earn 20*$1 = $<<20*1=20>>20 per each of them. So he will earn 5 * 20 = <<5*20>>=100
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunes is $64 + $41 + $100= $<<64+41+100=205>>205.
#### 205"," First find the weight of all the tunes, which is 64+41+20 = 125 kilograms
Since each kilogram costs $1.0, Henry can earn 125 * 1 = $<<125*1=125.00>>125.00
 Henry needs to learn if this problem is more or less difficulty for him. It being an easier problem makes sense to him more clearly.

On the sidewalk, Andrea walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 27-ft walk, in minutes?","On the beach, Andrea walks at a rate of 12 fts per 48 minutes, or 12/48 = 1/4 fts per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/4 = 0.5 fts per minute.
To walk 15 ft(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 15/0.5 = <<15/0.5=30>>30 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Andrea 48+30 = <<48+30=78>>78 minutes to walk her favorite route.
#### 78"," We need to find Andrea’s speed. We know she walks 27 ft in 48 minutes, so her speed is 27 ft / 48 min = 0.5625 ft per minute. Since her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach, her speed on the beach is 0.5625 ft/min*2 = 1.125 ft/min.
