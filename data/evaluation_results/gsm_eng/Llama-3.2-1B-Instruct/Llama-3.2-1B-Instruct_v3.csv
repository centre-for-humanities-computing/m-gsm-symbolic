Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+150=280
Subtracting the 150 from both sides, we get 2x=130
We divide each side by two, leaving x=65. This means Abby has 65 yards of fence left over.
#### 65"," Let's say Abby gets x yards of fence to work on. Since Olivia gets 150 yards + x yards, and together they have 280 yards, 150 + x + x = 280 because 150 + 2x = 280
Add x to 150 and subtract 280 from both sides: 150 + 3x = 280
Subtract 150 from both sides: 3x = 130

If she can skip at 4 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking?","If Olivia can skip at two thirds the speed she can run, then she can run at 4*3/2=<<4*3/2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/2=3 miles per hour.
If half of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 4*1/2=<<4*1/2=2>>2 hours.
If half of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 2 hours at 3 miles per hour, or 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.
#### 18"," If she skips twice as fast as she walks at 4 miles per hour, that leaves 2 miles per hour for her run time. So, 4/2 = 2 miles/hour.
Since she runs for half of her time, that time is 2/2 = 1 hour.
Since she skips for half of the time, that time is 2/2 = 1 hour.
Now add up the total amount she saves:#### 1",0.538428726955317,False
