So the total is 104 + 7 = <<104+7=绝#### 1111120934672097982417610244292416162182017212617577121622882212251421923438714650748345161212626539388457337161372926480921959926777912921293419118914113971182863118292667373907911851163522481403479988213054055455731475764014362924925963417769447531053015689813319225421181721806723370934939455757799792673749746251587583070548100405565428773831743494184805647522444275747754175200095051612595379076119718745575975584667114975403591612389470949191730523571435819945471597163641139780589374694341543210693795148459552017372152738537621411242372102211339538803583880313532446535127882513251015597444775812192098874517077302719448259357036688766861062637488856315671518207297698261295765851534657981102561160977288285597891568908263156451350747586751244786116473556625458631273125512964458393854760226988173379857660862301500832796727863562941007247038019825106135451424515513350022744288396246760312391070347839363506693966658813381804656273494586297255412479930460722685290579062609953496356562292258255338222224508528269660131894985365456416804539372449279095665517922636340888058365665783831722270988145928137791148555425304675945489",1.7137521780095994,False
473,Ethan saw a 150-foot shark with 3 12-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 12 inches/remora * 3 remoras = <<12*3=36>>36 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 36 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<36/12=3>>3 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 3 foot / 150 feet * 100% = 2%

#### 2"," The shark is 150 feet long and has remoras that are 12 inches long on each. Thus each shark is 150 + 12 * 3 = 162 inches long for a remoras length. If 3 * 12 = 36 inches then this represents 36% of the shark :  162 / 162 * 100 = 36%

164,"Emily is trying to decide whether to do her financial planning herself or hire one tax consultant. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 5 fewer hours of contract work, losing £48/hour in missed income. The tax consultant charges £53. How much more money will she have if she hires the tax consultant?","First find the total lost revenue if Emily does her financial planning herself: £48/hour * 5 hours = £<<48*5=240>>240
Then subtract the tax consultant's charge to find how much money Emily saves: £240 - £53 = £<<240-53=187>>187
#### 187"," Emily should hire the consultant because 53 - 48 = 5
If you're saving savings, it's saving 5 hours or 5 * 60 = 300 of your time per week.
You'd be earning 52 * 300 = 15,600
So she'll earn 15,600 after hiring the tax consultant to &quot;save&quot; 300
