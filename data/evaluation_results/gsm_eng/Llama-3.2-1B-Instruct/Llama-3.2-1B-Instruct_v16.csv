184,Joshua is rolling a 8-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 6 numbers greater than 2 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 6/8=75%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 75% - 25% = 50%.
#### 50"," There are 3 odd numbers: 1, 3, and 5.
So with 8 possible outcomes, there is 1/8 * 3/8 = 3/64 that Joshua rolls two odd numbers.
Therefore, the probability that he rolls a number greater than 2 is (8-3)/8 = 5/8.
To find the percentage, multiply by 100, which is 5/8 * 100 = 62.5% .
