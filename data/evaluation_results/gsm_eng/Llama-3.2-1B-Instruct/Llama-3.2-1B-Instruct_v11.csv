Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 144 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<144/12=12>>12 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 12 foot / 60 feet * 100% = 20%

#### 20"," It takes a 36-inch remora to draw 1 inch. So 4 remoras will draw 180 inches.
Therefore, the shark is 180/60 = 3 inches longer than the remoras.
