Out of the 18 liters, 18*2/3 = <<18*2/3=12>>12 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 6 + 12 = <<6+12=18>>18 liters of water out of the 48 liters.
#### 18", There are 60 liters since 20 + 30 = 40. 2/3 is 40/3 and 1/5 is 3. 2/3 * 40/3 + 1/5 * 3 = 40/9 + 1/5 = 40/9 + 1.8 = 44.5555.

If each pan holds 13 brownies, how many pans worth of brownies should she bake?","She has enough frosting for 7 * 13 = <<7*13=91>>91 brownies.
She needs 91 / 13 = <<91/13=7>>7 pans to bake all of the brownies.
#### 7"," First multiply the number of jars by the number of brownies each jar can cover. 7 jars * 13 brownies = 91 brownies
Then divide the total brownies by the number of brownies each pan covers. 91 brownies / 13 brownies = 7
She needs to bake 7 pans worth of brownies because 7 ≠ 7p

184,Oliver is rolling a 8-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"There are 6 numbers greater than 2 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 6/8=75%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 75% - 25% = 50%.
#### 50"," 3/8 of the time, he rolls greater than 2, which is 27/8
Since 3/8 is less than 2/8 he has to calculate 100-27/(8*1) = 100-27/8 = 8.25
To express the percentage in the desired format, multiply 8.25 by 100: 825/1000 = 8.25/1000 = 825/10000
Express it as a percentage: (825/10000)*100 = (825/10000)*1 =#### 000325",0.9306544010760263,False

387 + 296 = <<387+296=683>>683 points
Together, Lucas and Claire scored 683 points.
#### 683"," First find out how many points Lucas scored because 387 / (2/3) = 387 * (3/2) = 1116
Then find out how many points Claire scored, which is 1116 + 38 = 1154
Finally add the points of Lucas and Claire to find the total points: 1116 + 1154 = <<1116+1154=2260>>2260
