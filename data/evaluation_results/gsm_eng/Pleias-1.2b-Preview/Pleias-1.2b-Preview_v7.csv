1264,"Eric is popping popcorn for a snack. As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 40 pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next 30 seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Eric takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Eric have to eat?","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3*40=<<3*40=120>>120 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 4*40=<<4*40=160>>160 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 160 / 2 = <<160/2=80>>80 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 80 / 4 = <<80/4=20>>20 kernels pop.
Thus, Eric has 40 + 120 + 160 + 80 + 20 = <<40+120+160+80+20=420>>420 pieces of popcorn to eat.
#### 420"," For a total of 4 units in a single batch, how many half-units are there? Four half-units is 6: 2+4=6/2+4=6/4
So Eric is 2+4 and 2+2
So he has 8 half-units.

107,"Carl watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched a 4-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 60-minute show. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode and a 15-minute show. On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 2-hour episodes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?","Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Thursday.
After Tuesday, he had 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 hours of TV left.
After Wednesday, he had 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 12 - 4 - 0.25 = 7.75 hours of TV left.
After Saturday, he had 7.75 - 4 = 3.75 hours of TV left.
Each 60-minute episode is 1 hour.
Thus, E = 3.75/1 = 3.75 episodes.
#### 3.75"," 20*4=<<20*4=160>>160 hours of TV.
So for a total of 640 hours of TV, Carl would have watched a little over 22 hours a week.

If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 4 fewer hours of contract work, losing £90/hour in missed income. The bookkeeper charges £134. How much more money will she have if she hires the bookkeeper?","First find the total lost revenue if Maya does her financial planning herself: £90/hour * 4 hours = £<<90*4=360>>360

1084,"If Abby and Jason have 440 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Jason getting 140 yards more than Abby, how much is left over for Abby?","Let x be the amount of fence Abby gets and y be the amount Jason gets. We know that y = x + 140, and y + x = 440.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+140=440
Subtracting the 140 from both sides, we get 2x=300
We divide each side by two, leaving x=150. This means Abby has 150 yards of fence left over.
#### 150"," Abby has 440-140 = 280 yards of fence.
If Abby gets 140 yards more than his partner, he ends up with 280+140=420 yards.
So if there's 480 yards on fence, then -280 yards will be left over forAbby.

He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 12-lb bags. Oats are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys forty 75-lb packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys eighteen 45-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1950 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 lbs of hay.
He is buying 6*12 = <<6*12=72>>72 lbs of cucumbers.
He is buying 18*45 = <<18*45=810>>810 lbs of apples.
He is buying 40*75 = <<40*75=3000>>3000 lbs of oats.
The weight of all the feed is 18 + 72 + 810 + 3000 = <<18+72+810+3000=3900>>3900 lbs.
Thus, the farmer needs 3900 / 1950 = <<3900/1950=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.
#### 2"," Since he can only sell about three trips per day due to the dead weight he puts in, and only concerns about the infeed, he comes down to one or two trips within the day.

Let x be the age of Andrea.              William has x+9/2 = 11 years old.

So William's cousin Andrea will be 11x years old.

99,"Jessica is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 26 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 10 potted plants on each of the 59 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 3 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Jessica remain with?","Two days ago, before receiving the plants, Jessica had 10*59 = <<10*59=590>>590 potted plants
After receiving an additional 26 plants, she therefore had a total of 590 + 26 = <<590+26=616>>616 potted plants
Tomorrow, Jessicas plant giveaway will be 59*3 = <<59*3=177>>177 potted plants.
She will therefore remain with 616 - 177 = <<616-177=439>>439 potted plants.
