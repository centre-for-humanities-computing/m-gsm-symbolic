473,Oliver saw a 60-foot shark with 6 30-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 30 inches/remora * 6 remoras = <<30*6=180>>180 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 180 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<180/12=15>>15 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 15 foot / 60 feet * 100% = 25%

#### 25"," The length of the shark = 20.
The length of the remoras + the length of the shark = 40.
The length of the shark is the product of the individual length of the bodies, Whereas the length of the remoras is the sum of the lengths of the two arms of the shark and four of the arm's lips.

1026,One miner can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a nickel pickaxe and 40% more with a steel pickaxe than with a nickel pickaxe. How many kgs of ore can 25 miners with steel pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?,"First find how much ore a miner can mine with an nickel pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 kgs/day
Then multiply that amount by 140% to find how much a miner can mine with a steel pickaxe: 10 kgs/day * 140% = <<10*140*.01=14>>14 kgs/day
Then multiply the amount one miner can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe by the number of miners: 14 kgs/day/miner * 25 miners = <<14*25=350>>350 kgs/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 350 kgs/day * 28 days = <<350*28=9800>>9800 kgs/day
#### 9800"," The 25 miners mine 45 / 28*5 /25 = <<45/28*5=0.395>>0.395 kgs of ore per day each.
28 days = <<28 days = 7*365 = <<28 days = 7695>>7695 days.
Therefore, 25 miners can mine 5 + 45 + 0.395 = <<75+net*10=145>>145 kgs of ore per day with 22 days.

The kernels increase to six times the initial popping rate in the next 30 seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds.

103,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 298 minutes to cover every 40 miles of the city. If the city is 60 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?","The city will be covered in 60/40 = <<60/40=1>>1 intervals of 298 minutes.
Thus, it will take 1 * 298 = <<1*298=298>>298 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.
#### 298"," If the city is 60m/10m/12m (miles/feet/yards) across from the oceanfront going in the direction of the church dreaming of the city, the fog bank will travel to the oceanfront by time 298 minutes/10 minutes/108 minutes.

661,David goes to the store to buy some tea. The normal brand of tea he buys costs €16 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 35% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses 2 kilogram of tea per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for €4. How much did everything cost?,"The tea he bought was 16*0.35=€<<16*0.35=5>>5 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys
So it cost 16+5=€<<16+5=21>>21 per kilogram
He goes through 2*7=<<2*7=14>>14 kilograms of tea a week
So he paid 21.6*14=€<<21.6*14=302>>302 on tea
That means his total bill was 302+4=€<<302+4=306>>306
#### 306"," The total cost = w * 150. The fraction w/(w + 1) = 3/5. w = 2 * 13 = 26. The total cost is w**3 * 150 = <<w**3=1976>>1976.
So the total cost is : <<1976>>1976 euros. As he bought 2 kg per day he bought 49 kg Dont know how much he paid for it.

39,"Claire can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is three fifths as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends three quarters of the time running and one quarter of the time walking?","If Claire can skip at three fifths the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*5/3=<<6*5/3=10>>10 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 10/2=5 miles per hour.
If one quarter of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 4*1/4=<<4*1/4=1>>1 hours.
If three quarters of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours.
Thus, she runs for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, or 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 miles.
She walks for 1 hours at 5 miles per hour, or 1*5=<<1*5=5>>5 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 30+5=<<30+5=35>>35 miles.
#### 35"," Claire can skip 12/4 = <<12/4=6>>6 miles. At this speed, she can reach the goal within four hours from now.

636,"Ella operates the cash register exactly four times as fast as her less-experienced colleague Madison. Daily, Madison processes 80 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?","While Madison is processing 80 orders in a day, Ella processes 80 orders/day*4=<<80*4=320>>320 orders/day.
In a day, they process 320 orders/day + 80 orders/day = <<320+80=400>>400 orders together.
The total number of orders the two processes in a week is 400 orders/day * 7 days/week = <<400*7=2800>>2800 orders
#### 2800"," Ella has 4*80 = 80*10 = <<80*10=8000>>8000 kg of paper printed. It costs Virginia to print 100 kg of paper. What is the total ticket value?

Solution: 80*10=8000
Therefore Virginia spends <<8000=10dollars>>10 dollars daily printing one ticket.

930,"When Lily watches her brother, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 49 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 49 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 23 multicolored rings on it. Lily recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her brother up to 208. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Lily has 49 + 49 + 23 + T = 121 + T = 208 toys for her brother.
Thus, T = 208 - 121 = <<208-121=87>>87 bouncy balls came in the tube.
