Lucas sells 14 tulips*$3 = $<<14*3=42>>42
Lucas sells 27 lilies*$3 = $<<27*3=81>>81
Lucas sells 41 roses*$5 = $<<41*5=205>>205
Altogether, Lucas will make $42 + $81 + $205 = $<<42+81+205=328>>328
#### 328"," He sells 3 per quarter = 1 times every 3 months *$3=11/3 = $3.
He sells 27/4 = <<27/4=21>> 21 tulips per quarter.
He sells 41/4 = <<41/4=28>> 28 lilies per quarter.
He sells 26/4 = <<26/4=15>> 15 roses per quarter.
The fair has only 4 quarters. So Lucas is winning $5.

He only wants enough carrots to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pounds bags. Wheats are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys forty 55-pounds packs. Oats are a staple to supplement the wheats, so he buys fifteen 50-pounds sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1500 poundss at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 poundss of hay.

737,"Matt wants to make different sized ice cubes with 144 lbs of water. He can make giant cubes that use 6 lbs per cube, medium cubes that use 2 lbs, and small cubes that use 1/5 lb. If he makes 4 giant cubes, 11 medium cubes, and 15 small cubes, how many lbs of water does he have left?","The giant cubes used up 24 lbs of water because 4 times 6 equals <<4*6=24>>24.
The medium cubes used up 22 lbs of water because 11 times 2 equals <<11*2=22>>22.
The small cubes used up 3 lbs of water because 15 times 1/5 equals 3.
This means that Matt has used up 49 lbs of water because 24 plus 22 plus 3 equals 49.
Matt has 95 lbs of water left because 144 minus 49 equals <<144-49=95>>95.
#### 95","

He can make 3 / 142=<<3/142=141>>141 cubes.
Each cubic inch of water (in the gross) weighs 141 lbs
The gross weight of 4 giant cubes = 141*(4/0.18= <<141*(4))/2= 142.25 lbs
He can now take 144 lbs of water with him so his mass becomes 141+144 lbs = <<141+144=285.25>>285 √lb
So his lbs left are 285#### 04583858538585385853858538550574054357552574054357552574054483553858538585385858538585405555555555555550000055000000155555555555555555555555555555555000005555550555000000017555555385775655574048505500475445655557584055000500008885887795455657884054388055488008547957885855577505385058552804894850045975004254564388557654560457008784035857775780803148249855053848598585314358579050055790044659595452888890444085740578065985954557403779035776585510194556858581414456575249535559285005068457500428364605590828575008554595598579572458406775788565850854984580078758545504535555580952040460549438597141048546673572124520788457770411557888498567940001795576500573510140057844720035795575845805548748920540637063235884728585858548597656885885858005673540735638058704388985885666855586736585858557236082876797705745606749753855395635848518538571873665862758710550538071408510000000568557482572585795577400853804200455638750450485806897000066285862175409660",1.4458318239776418,False

Purple cards make up to 63 + 82 = <<63+82=145>>145 cards.

921,"A pizza has 12 pieces. If Ethan can eat 4 pieces a day while Isabella can eat twice as much, how many days will the pizza last?","Isabella can eat 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 pieces a day.
Together, Ethan and Isabella can eat 4 + 8 = <<4+8=12>>12 pieces a day.
So, a pizza will last for 12/12 = <<12/12=1>>1 days.
#### 1"," There will be 12*2 times in a day: <<12*2>>24 The mixture will be <<24+12=36>>36 days in a week.

989,Anna can peel 12 clams a minute and saute 20 clams in 19 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 clams?,"First find how long it takes Anna to peel the clams: 60 clams / 12 clams/minute = <<60/12=5>>5 minutes
Then find how many batches of clams she needs to cook: 60 clams / 20 clams/batch = <<60/20=3>>3 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 19 minutes/batch = <<3*19=57>>57 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Anna spends: 57 minutes + 5 minutes = <<57+5=62>>62 minutes
#### 62"," Anna can peel 12 clams a minute and saute 20 clams in 19 minutes.
 She can peel a clump of clams in each minute and then add two to the amount held down in 19 minutes. That gets you peel a cluster of clams a minute and saute enough clams in 19 minutes each.

473,Anna saw a 250-foot dolphin with 3 40-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 40 inches/remora * 3 remoras = <<40*3=120>>120 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 120 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<120/12=10>>10 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 10 foot / 250 feet * 100% = 4%

#### 4"," Anna saw a 5/6d of the overall length of the boat would be how much of the body length of the dolphin?
250*1/3=250/60=<<250/60=79>>79 percent.

1084,"If Abby and Oliver have 220 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Oliver getting 190 yards more than Abby, how much is left over for Abby?","Let x be the amount of fence Abby gets and y be the amount Oliver gets. We know that y = x + 190, and y + x = 220.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+190=220
Subtracting the 190 from both sides, we get 2x=30
We divide each side by two, leaving x=15. This means Abby has 15 yards of fence left over.
#### 15"," They are 6mm apart, so if each had to Smith with 19 a rule, and if two things are ""smaller than the other"" then they are in a ""pair."" So the end result is that they have 220*6/2=<<220*6/2=50,260>50,260 yards left over for Abby.

After 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 385 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<385*2=770>>770 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 1425 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1425 beds - 770 beds = <<1425-770=655>>655 unoccupied beds.

The rest of the steelheads are 5-2 = <<5-2=3>>3. He will earn 30*€1.75 = €<<30*1.75=52.5>>52.5 per each of them. So he will earn 3 * 52.5 = <<3*52.5>>=157.5
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the steelheads is €84 + €52.5 + €157.5= €<<84+52.5+157.5=293>>294.

406,"At Joe's house, there are thrice as many bananas as corns. He has a total of 84 corns in his house. Joe bought 35 more corns at the store and 19 fewer bananas than the number of corns. Find the combined total of the number of bananas and corns Joe has in the house?","Before buying any banana and corn, Joe had thrice as many bananas as corns, which is 84 corns*3 banana/corn = <<84*3=252>>252 bananas
The total number of bananas and corns that Joe had before is 252 bananas + 84 corns = <<252+84=336>>336 items
When he bought 19 fewer bananas than corns, he bought 35 bananas - 19 bananas = <<35-19=16>>16 bananas
In total, he bought 16 bananas + 35 corns = <<16+35=51>>51 items
After the purchases, Joe has 336 items + 51 items = <<336+51=387>>387 total bananas and corns combined.
#### 387"," The sum of the different quantities used to purchase bananas and corns is 888
Therefore, the combined output of those volumes is
858 + 888
Therefore, there are 860 BANANAS + 888 CORNS in the house.
