1207,"Bob caught 4 trouts last Saturday, the first trout he caught weighs 75 pounds, the second trout he caught weighs 35 pounds, and the remaining trout he caught weighs 30 pounds. If a pound of trout costs $1.75, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?","Bob will earn 75*$1.75 = $<<75*1.75=131.25>>131.25 from the first trout.
He will earn 35*$1.75 = $<<35*1.75=61.25>>61.25 for the second trout.
The rest of the trouts are 4-2 = <<4-2=2>>2. He will earn 30*$1.75 = $<<30*1.75=52.5>>52.5 per each of them. So he will earn 2 * 52.5 = <<2*52.5>>=105
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is $131.25 + $61.25 + $105= $<<131.25+61.25+105=297>>297.
#### 297"," Let's simplify the equation. The trouts he caught last Saturday weigh 75 + 35 + 30 = 150 pounds. He will pay for the fish only if the trouts weigh more than 75 pounds.
1 pound of 75 pounds costs $1.75.
So he pays for the fish if they weigh more than 75 pounds.

1264,"Ella is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 100 pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then two times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next 30 seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Ella takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Ella have to eat?","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 2*100=<<2*100=200>>200 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 4*100=<<4*100=400>>400 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 400 / 2 = <<400/2=200>>200 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 200 / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 kernels pop.
Thus, Ella has 100 + 200 + 400 + 200 + 50 = <<100+200+400+200+50=950>>950 pieces of popcorn to eat.
#### 950"," Initially 100 pops divided by 67:000 = 1/4. Then after the second pop, only two popping (or 2/4 of one) act on a two. In the third, fourth, and fifth pop, 4/4 = 2/3 of the pops act on a three (2/3 of 2/3 = 1/3).
