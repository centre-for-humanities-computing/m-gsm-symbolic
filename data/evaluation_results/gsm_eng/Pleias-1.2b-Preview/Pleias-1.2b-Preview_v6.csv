232,"Joe went to their greenhouse to pick some raspberries and found half as many bees as caterpillars in the garden. If there were 24 caterpillars, calculate the total number of insects in the garden.","If there were 24 caterpillars, the total number of bees in the garden is 1/2*24 caterpillars = 12 bees
The total number of insects in the garden is 12 bees + 24 caterpillars = <<12+24=36>>36 insects
#### 36"," 24 lessons*2/3 = <<24*2/3=16>>16 caterpillars.
However, if Charles did not go to his ice cream shop, there were 24 insects in total.

Lets assume Joe found all 24 insects - so, 24 insects + 36 insects = 54 insect.

There were 24 insects + 16 insects = <<24+16=36>>36 insects in the garden.

If a kilogram of tune costs €1.0, how much will he earn after selling all the tunes to the market?","Chris will earn 57*€1 = €<<57*1=57>>57 from the first tune.
He will earn 37*€1 = €<<37*1=37>>37 for the second tune.
The rest of the tunes are 6-2 = <<6-2=4>>4. He will earn 24*€1 = €<<24*1=24>>24 per each of them. So he will earn 4 * 24 = <<4*24>>=96

459,"A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys a variety of oats, apples, beets and hay. Since hay are a rare treat, he only buys six 2-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the cows while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Oats are the main diet of his cows, so he buys forty-two 70-pound packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys twenty 60-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2100 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 pounds of hay.
He is buying 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 pounds of beets.
He is buying 20*60 = <<20*60=1200>>1200 pounds of apples.
He is buying 42*70 = <<42*70=2940>>2940 pounds of oats.
The weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 1200 + 2940 = <<12+48+1200+2940=4200>>4200 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 4200 / 2100 = <<4200/2100=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.
#### 2"," Each bag of oats weighs a little less than an apple tie weight. Each bag of apples weighs all of a few pounds. 22 - 2 - 4 - 6 - 14 - 10*6 = <<22-2-4-6-14-10*6=10>>10 bags. 2 bags*2 packs = <<2*2 packs=8>>8 packs.

20,"I have 12 liters of peach drink that are three quarters water and I wish to add it to 28 liters of apple drink that is one quarter water. But as I pour it, I spill four liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 36 liters?","There are 28*1/4 = <<28*1/4=7>>7 liters of water from the 28 liters apple drink.
After four liters of peach drink was spilled, there were 12-4 = <<12-4=8>>8 liters of peach drink left.
Out of the 8 liters, 8*3/4 = <<8*3/4=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 7 + 6 = <<7+6=13>>13 liters of water out of the 36 liters.
#### 13"," There are 36 liters*0.75=<<36*0.75=33.75>>33.75 liters of water.
Thus, if there was 28 liters of apple drink, this means there was 1/4 less than 33.75 liters of water.
The total remaining water is therefore either 33.75+1/4=<<33.75+0.75=30>>30 liters, or 33.75+3/4, or 33.75+1/2, or 33.75+0.5, or 33####

406,"At Michael's house, there are thrice as many pears as persimmons. He has a total of 43 persimmons in his house. Michael bought 72 more persimmons at the store and 34 fewer pears than the number of persimmons. Find the combined total of the number of pears and persimmons Michael has in the house?","Before buying any pear and persimmon, Michael had thrice as many pears as persimmons, which is 43 persimmons*3 pear/persimmon = <<43*3=129>>129 pears
The total number of pears and persimmons that Michael had before is 129 pears + 43 persimmons = <<129+43=172>>172 items
When he bought 34 fewer pears than persimmons, he bought 72 pears - 34 pears = <<72-34=38>>38 pears
In total, he bought 38 pears + 72 persimmons = <<38+72=110>>110 items
After the purchases, Michael has 172 items + 110 items = <<172+110=282>>282 total pears and persimmons combined.
#### 282"," 72 + 34 = <<72+34=106>>106 persimmons in the house.
Michael purchased 72 more persimmons and 46 less pears than the number of persimmons.
So, Michael bought 106*46 = <<106*46=572>>572 persimmons and 106 - 72 = <<106-72=34>>34 pears.

What is the final value of all Jessica's shares?","First find the initial total value of Jessica's purchase: 14 shares * €23/share = €<<14*23=322>>322
Then find the amount of the first price increase: €322 * 0.95 = €<<322*0.95=305.9>>305
Add that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: €322 + €305.9 = €<<322+305.9=627.9>>627
Then multiply that amount by 5% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: €627.9 * 5% = €<<627.9*5*.01=31.395>>31
Then subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: €627 - €31 = €<<627-31=596>>596

11,"Claire went to the bakery and bought various types of baked goods. She bought 8 dozen eclairs which cost $12 per dozen, 10 dozen tarts which cost $86 per dozen, and 9 dozen brownies for $118 per dozen. How much was the total cost?","The total charge for the eclairs was 8*$12 = $<<8*12=96>>96.
The total charge for the tarts was 10*$86 = $<<10*86=860>>860.
The total charge for the brownies was 9*$118 = $<<9*118=1062>>1062.
Therefore the total amount Claire paid for the baked goods was $96 + $860 + $1062 = $<<96+860+1062=2018>>2018.
#### 2018"," The cost of the baked goods were:
- <<eelairs» = 48*12 = <<48*12=504>>504 cents
- <<tarts» = 66*86 = <<66*86=696>>696 cents
- <<brownies» = 99*118 = <<99*118=1194>>1194 cents
Total cost: 1120*504 + 1126*696 + 1128*1194 = <<1120*504+1126*696+1128*1194=169376>>169376 cents.

184,Joe is rolling a d12 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 11 numbers greater than 1 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 11/12=91%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 91% - 25% = 66%.
#### 66"," Joe rolls d12 - 1 * d12 = <<d12-1*d12=d12-3>>d12 - d12 = <<d-1*14-d-1=57>>57Too few d12 rolls 13 to 16.So 39d40 (2 d1), 39d50 (2 d2), 39d70 (3 d3), etc.
So say a filed four times as many as he rolls and his odds are expected to be pretty good.
