Henry can harvest his raspberrys 12 / 12 = <<12/12=1>>1 times per year
Therefore Henry can harvest 2295*1 = <<2295*1=2295>>2295 raspberrys per year.
#### 2295"," Henry has 85*12=(1,152) square meters of raspberry field, so 11,152 raspberries can be harvested in 12 months = 1,152 raspberries × 12 months =1,152 raspberries.
Then Henry harvested 1,152 raspberries in 1 month.

Later, her husband also bought a package of 10 new plates and gave them to Jessica. While Jessica was making the stuffed peppers, she used four of the plates to sample her stuffed peppers.
