520,"Amanda is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a sweater, vest, cardigan, mittens, and leg warmers for each of them. It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a sweater, 10 for a vest, 13 for a cardigan, 18 for a pair of mittens, and 16 for a pair of leg warmers. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?","A full outfit for each child will require 5 skeins per sweater + 10 skeins per vest + 13 skeins per cardigan + 18 skeins per pair of mittens + 16 skeins per pair of leg warmers = <<5+10+13+18+16=62>>62 skeins of wool.
So to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3*62 = <<3*62=186>>186 skeins of wool.
#### 186"," The total number of pieces for each item is 1345 + 2525 + 262 = <<1345+2525+262=4550>>4550 and so we need to buy ~8/3 = <<8/3=2>>2 skeins of wool per item.
In total, she will grind the filaments together, but only need to gather ~18/3 = <<18/3=6>>6 skeins of wool.

How should the are solve?

473,Emma saw a 60-foot shark with 4 36-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 36 inches/remora * 4 remoras = <<36*4=144>>144 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 144 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<144/12=12>>12 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 12 foot / 60 feet * 100% = 20%

#### 20"," The longer length of the remoras is <<26-4=2>>2 thirds and so the longer we're calling the length of remora body.

242,Bob was a pen pal with 8 people. He stopped being penpals with 4 of them. They each send 3 letters a week that are 5 pages long. He responds in kind. He can write a page every 9 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week?,"Bob is penpals with 8-4=<<8-4=4>>4 people
Thus he gets 4*3=<<4*3=12>>12 letters a week
So he writes 12*5=<<12*5=60>>60 pages a week
So he writes for 60*9=<<60*9=540>>540 minutes a week
So he writes 540/60=<<540/60=9>>9 hours a week
#### 9"," Bob is a pdepend at 9 minutes, which means he spends 9 minutes for every minute he spends writing. So by stopping being pdepend, he can be writing a page in 9 minutes, which is equivalent to 8 h.

As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 40 pop in the first 26 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 26 seconds. The kernels increase to seven times the initial popping rate in the next 26 seconds, but in the final 26 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 26 seconds. After Eric takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 26 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Eric have to eat?","In the second 26 seconds of cooking, 3*40=<<3*40=120>>120 kernels pop.

In the final 26 seconds, 280 / 2 = <<280/2=140>>140 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 140 / 4 = <<140/4=35>>35 kernels pop.
Thus, Eric has 40 + 120 + 280 + 140 + 35 = <<40+120+280+140+35=615>>615 pieces of popcorn to eat.

39,"Anna can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 5 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?","If Anna can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 10/2=5 miles per hour.
If two thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*2/3=<<6*2/3=4>>4 hours.
If one third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 10 miles per hour, or 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 5 miles per hour, or 4*5=<<4*5=20>>20 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 20+20=<<20+20=40>>40 miles.
#### 40"," She can skip at 5*0.5 = 2.5 miles per hour.

164,"Lily is trying to decide whether to do her financial planning herself or hire one financial advisor. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 13 fewer hours of contract work, losing $93/hour in missed income. The financial advisor charges $106. How much more money will she have if she hires the financial advisor?","First find the total lost revenue if Lily does her financial planning herself: $93/hour * 13 hours = $<<93*13=1209>>1209
Then subtract the financial advisor's charge to find how much money Lily saves: $1209 - $106 = $<<1209-106=1103>>1103
#### 1103"," The hourly cost she will lose when she does it herself is $44/hour. The hourly cost she will gain when she hires the financial advisor is $33/hour. The combined amount total of the savings she'll get is $88/hour. So the total savings opportunity is 88/(1/2)*(13)**2=<<88/(1/2)*(13)**2=44>>44 hours.

984,"Jessica has a flower bed that is 166 meters long. Jessica wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Jessica's flowers grow 5 inches wide so she needs to leave 9.25 meters between every plant. Jessica already owns 16 flowers. Each flowering plant costs €5 at the store, how much money will Jessica spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Jessica's flower bed is 166 meters / 9.25 meters per plant = <<166/9.25=17>>17 plants needed.
Jessica needs to buy 17 plants - 16 plants = <<17-16=1>>1 plants needed to purchase.
Jessica will spend 1 plants * €5 = €<<1*5=9>>9.
#### 9"," J = Jessica
This takes value of 1 time, followed by a storage fraction of 1/25 for each plant. Value to spend at the store is of 4 flowers multiplied by the cost given as €5. The interest is of €4.25, so the cash would be of €109.25.

982,"In Dr. Lee's class of 144 students, 38% of the class are swimmers. Out of the remaining class, 40% of the students are robotics club members or part of choir members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. How many students are leaving early?","38% of the 144 student class are swimmers so that's 0.38*144 = <<0.38*144=54>>54 students
There are 144 students and 54 are swimmers so that leaves 144-54 = <<144-54=90>>90 students
40% of the remaining 90 students are part of choir members or robotics club members so that's 0.4*90 = <<0.4*90=36>>36 students
54 students are swimmers and 36 are part of choir members/robotics club members so 54+36 = <<54+36=90>>90 students will be leaving early
#### 90"," Anyone who wants to leave early cites other reasons.
Therefore the number of leave-alarm class members should be at least 3-38%*32+(40%+40%)*32=28-2=26>>26 leave-alarm students leaving before class. So 26-(2^3) = <<26-(2^3)>>28 >>28.
Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 26 - 28,####

Eric can harvest his grapess 12 / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 times per year
Therefore Eric can harvest 3150*3 = <<3150*3=9450>>9450 grapess per year.

If each serving of cookies has 250 calories and I only have 1250 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 1250/250 of a serving = 5 of a serving
We also know that a 300 oz bag of cookies has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300 oz/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 ozs

On the sidewalk, Jessica walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 54 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 28-feet walk, in minutes?","On the beach, Jessica walks at a rate of 9 feets per 54 minutes, or 9/54 = 1/6 feets per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/6 = 0.3333333333333333 feets per minute.
To walk 19 feet(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 19/0.3333333333333333 = <<19/0.3333333333333333=57>>57 minutes.

He paid $620,000*5/100 = $31,000 for the brokerage fee.
So, Dr. Martinez paid a total of $6200 + $31,000 + $220,000 = $257,200 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.

The roller coaster cost $7 a ride. How many friends can she invite?","The roller coaster will cost $14 per person because 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14
Each person costs $26 because 6 + 6 + 14 = <<6+6+14=26>>26
10 total people can attend because 260 / 26 = <<260/26=10>>10
She can invite 9 friends because 10 - 1 =<<10-1=9>>9
#### 9"," Claire needs to win $260-$5 for one round of mini-golf. While $7 a ride takes $260, Claire's 11 friends will each win $8 for the ride. Therefore, they win 11*7=$77 of it each. To win Claire's 11 friends, she needs 11*77=<<11*77=171>>171 different places to visit.

If he makes 4 giant cubes, 8 medium cubes, and 15 small cubes, how many ozs of water does he have left?","The giant cubes used up 16 ozs of water because 4 times 4 equals <<4*4=16>>16.
The medium cubes used up 16 ozs of water because 8 times 2 equals <<8*2=16>>16.
The small cubes used up 3 ozs of water because 15 times 1/5 equals 3.
This means that Oliver has used up 35 ozs of water because 16 plus 16 plus 3 equals 35.

434,The vending machines sell pretzels for 70 cents and gum for 75 cents. Chris spent $10 and got 7 bags of pretzels and had 6% of his money left in change. How many gum did he buy?,"Chris got $0.6 in change because $10*6/100 = <<10*6/100=0.6>>0.6
Chris spent $9.4 because 10 - 0.6 = <<10-0.6=9.4>>9.4
Chris spent $4.9 on pretzels because 7*0.7 = <<7*0.7=4.9>>4.9
Chris spent 4.5 on gum because 9.4 - 4.9 = <<9.4-4.9=4.5>>4.5
Chris bought 6 gum because 4.5 / 0.75 = <<6=6>>6
#### 6"," He bought 7*70 + 6 = <<7*70+6=30>>30 (since he has 30 pennies).
By checking the difference between the denominational denominator and the numerial denominator, we can find 10 cents multiplied by 70 and subtract it from 75.

458,"Sarah's dog has 5 puppies, 8 of which have spots. Madison's dog has 9 puppies, 6 of which have spots. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?","First find the total number of puppies: 5 puppies + 9 puppies = <<5+9=14>>14 puppies
Then find the total number of puppies with spots: 8 puppies + 6 puppies = <<8+6=14>>14 puppies
Then divide the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of puppies with spots: 14 puppies / 14 puppies * 100% = 100%
#### 100"," A combination of Madison and her dog's puppies generally do not have spots, but Madison's is the only dog that does. Therefore, Madison's dog has the percentage **80**.
And Madison has 5*0.8=5.0% of his puppies.
The remainder of the puppies (3 puppies) have **0%** spots.
Wanna know how many puppies####
