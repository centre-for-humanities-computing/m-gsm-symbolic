The total number of kiwis and pears that Joshua had before is 495 kiwis + 99 pears = <<495+99=594>>594 items
When he bought 42 fewer kiwis than pears, he bought 72 kiwis - 42 kiwis = <<72-42=30>>30 kiwis
In total, he bought 30 kiwis + 72 pears = <<30+72=102>>102 items

799,A loaf of sourdough at the bakery costs £6. Bagels cost £3 each. How much more do 4 loaves of sourdough cost than 2 bagels?,"4 loaves of sourdough cost 4 * £6 = £<<4*6=24>>24.
2 bagels cost 2 * £3 = £<<2*3=6>>6.
The loaves of sourdough cost £24 - £6 = £<<24-6=18>>18 more than the bagels.
#### 18"," 4 bags of sourdough at a pinch would add up to 4x8 - 2 = 12potatoes actually. Let's assume 0.1kg of sourdough is equivalent to 2x3 = 6potatoes. Raise that to the power of 6. In this case, the potatoes will cost 4x6 = 24pence additional. Therefore, 4loaves of sourdough + 4 potatoes now add up to 12p####

Then divide the number of orange spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 205 spools / 360 spools * 100% = 56%
#### 56"," David has 70/80 spools of orange thread (80 % blue). Then, David's spools are 10% orange, 10% blue, 5% white, and 5% yellow. Thus, 70/80 = <<70/80=8>>8.

The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds, but in the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Madison takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Madison have to eat?","In the second 10 seconds of cooking, 2*70=<<2*70=140>>140 kernels pop.

In the final 10 seconds, 280 / 2 = <<280/2=140>>140 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 140 / 4 = <<140/4=35>>35 kernels pop.
Thus, Madison has 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 + 35 = <<70+140+280+140+35=665>>665 pieces of popcorn to eat.

He also got a 126 * 4 = $<<126*4=504>>504 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of June.

473,Emily saw a 120-foot dolphin with 9 80-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 80 inches/remora * 9 remoras = <<80*9=720>>720 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<720/12=60>>60 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 60 foot / 120 feet * 100% = 50%

#### 50"," The combined length of the remoras is 80 + 100 + 120 = <<8000 + 80000x0000000=184>>184 inches
They are curved, so let's ignore any forward movement.
So the dolphin is estimated to have been about 184 beam lengths (18 inches long) in height.

If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in eight hours if she spends one quarter of the time running and three quarters of the time walking?","If Ellen can skip at three quarters the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*4/3=<<3*4/3=4>>4 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is thrice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 4/3=1.3333333333333333 miles per hour.
If three quarters of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 8*3/4=<<8*3/4=6>>6 hours.
If one quarter of the time is spent running, then she runs for 8-6=<<8-6=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 4 miles per hour, or 2*4=<<2*4=8>>8 miles.
She walks for 6 hours at 1.3333333333333333 miles per hour, or 6*1.3333333333333333=<<6*1.3333333333333333=8>>8 miles.

The medium cubes used up 32 ozs of water because 8 times 4 equals <<8*4=32>>32.
The small cubes used up 2 ozs of water because 8 times 1/4 equals 2.
This means that Eric has used up 90 ozs of water because 56 plus 32 plus 2 equals 90.

1133,"Emily walks 20 fts every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 8 fts of walking on the beach and 12 ft(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Emily walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-ft walk, in minutes?","On the beach, Emily walks at a rate of 8 fts per 56 minutes, or 8/56 = 1/7 fts per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/7 = 0.2857142857142857 fts per minute.
To walk 12 ft(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 12/0.2857142857142857 = <<12/0.2857142857142857=42>>42 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Emily 56+42 = <<56+42=98>>98 minutes to walk her favorite route.
#### 98"," Taking 4 minutes off the (8-12)/4 pace (halfway through the walk), their walk on the beach is 75 fts + (-4) minutes = <<75 fts+6 minutes+=- 6 minutes>>75 ft * 0.76 minutes/ft
They walk 4 * (75 / 20) ft at a pace of h/2*(75 - 6) + 4 minutes = <((4*75)/20) h/2*6 minutes>>((4*75)/20) h/2 * 6 minutes

How much time did she spend playing these games?,"It takes 23 minutes to complete a word puzzle and she completed 2 for a total of 23*2 = <<23*2=46>>46 minutes
It takes 5 minutes to complete a brain teaser and she completed 10 for a total of 5*10 = <<5*10=50>>50 minutes
She spent 46 minutes on word puzzles and 50 minutes on brain teasers for a total of 46+50 = <<46+50=96>>96 minutes
#### 96"," Ava has difficulty playing any games. So if she takes 23 minutes to solve a word puzzle and 18 minutes to solve a brain teaser and 5 minutes to solve a concept map, she's playing games all day. Therefore, she thoroughly plays games 18% of the time she's playing games.

The sisters have 4 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 130 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?","Amanda and Emma have already collected 17 + 36 signatures = <<17+36=53>>53 signatures.

184,Alex is rolling a 10-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 9 numbers greater than 1 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 9/10=90%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 90% - 25% = 65%.
#### 65"," According to our die rolling rules, Alex is a favorable die roll when the rolling numbers are 5, 9, 13 and 17. Therefore, there is a 61% chance he rolls 5, or the numbers respect 10.

He then spends 1/3 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 8+2=<<8+2=10>>10 classes a day
That means he spends 60*10=<<60*10=600>>600 minutes per day in class

That means he spends 3600*1/3=<<3600*1/3=1200>>1200 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.

1084,"If Ethan and Kenneth have 340 meters of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Kenneth getting 20 meters more than Ethan, how much is left over for Ethan?","Let x be the amount of fence Ethan gets and y be the amount Kenneth gets. We know that y = x + 20, and y + x = 340.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+20=340
Subtracting the 20 from both sides, we get 2x=320
We divide each side by two, leaving x=160. This means Ethan has 160 meters of fence left over.
#### 160"," If they agree to split the fence, and Kenneth gets 50 meters, how much is left over for Ethan?
A: 340 meters * 1 - ((10*20)/(50-10)) = <<340m*1-1/10*60>>60
The answer is 60 meters. They have now divided the entire fence between them by 1/10.

How much money does Sally have left?","Sally is buying 1 pound for $5 and gets 1 pound 1/12 off. So 1/12 off of 1 pound is $5*1/12 = $0.4166666666666667. The rest of 1 pound does not have discount and costs 1*$5 = $5, so total is $5+$55/12+$5=$175/12
8 magnets at $0 each is 8*0=$<<8*0=0>>0
When you add all her purchases, 175/12+$3+$0 = $<<175/12+3+0=17>>17
