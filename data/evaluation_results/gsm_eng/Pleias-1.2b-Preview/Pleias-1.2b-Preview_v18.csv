473,Madison saw a 200-foot dolphin with 6 20-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 20 inches/remora * 6 remoras = <<20*6=120>>120 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 120 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<120/12=10>>10 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 10 foot / 200 feet * 100% = 5%

#### 5"," The combined length of the remoras + 6200v * 9 =  <<6200v * 9>>9 is 200 foot
So the percentage is: <<200>>9,2%
So there is a % of 6 + 2 + 9/3 ( = <<6+2+9/3>>3%), so <<6+2+9/3%>>3% = <<6+2+9/3%>>3%
So Madison's total length is 8 foot for him

After 4 weeks, Maya and Ashley compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Maya has 32 signatures in her book, and Ashley has 48. The sisters have 3 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 120 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?","Maya and Ashley have already collected 32 + 48 signatures = <<32+48=80>>80 signatures.
Since their goal is 120, they need to collect 120 - 80 signatures. 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 signatures
#### 40"," First, calculate the number of signatures the designers were already in their book at the beginning of the round. This is easy! 32 + 48 = <<32+48=80>>80 signatures. Then, calculate the number of signatures Maya and Ashley still have left to complete when the break ends, and multiply this number by:#### 80511119319204332284021724041915242866322234695353474625344708121008374444018841711182013356781000000039999546517410444788298999176816568755268033332212834260444444479007440176443575183330122007029744173371420243612151620481715224738756270962032162032265552414322702642311965134493704742018748895166176794612474726038473931050712428277215552436121661844478126718281391322283333224192755256461133410175933345447404941342102432129315612204513549821531234874136121738412903442618175217339521303790694367466529365729384436569791422100443694338230300436388864241728192698441355387000143619202934322317776623610934575060799764765065040192319041005938126716124207651612566725584357006300141170327722238225472103919072116163849724006853114990653361547317210635981942661999666910000223419314215723141208937267993961021290177403120205882729714015568929029225162872029293806128307170964673472354388922337493157255267410887382125049467000658750487350247211505223358932976796721420394762924257309530135130982125081333892483525505264384533206",1.3841621200554073,False

554,When the water is cold Lucas swims a kilometer in 13 minutes. When the water is warm Lucas swims a kilometer in 4 minutes more than thrice as long. How much longer does Lucas take to swim 2 kilometers on a hot day than a cold day?,"Cold water kilometer = <<13=13>>13 minutes
Warm water kilometer = 4+3*13=43 minutes
2 kilometers in cold water: 2(13)=<<2*13=26>>26 minutes
2 kilometers in warm water: 2(43)=<<2*43=86>>86 minutes
Lucas takes 86-26=<<86-26=60>>60 minutes longer
#### 60"," Lucas can swim a kilometer in 13 minutes + 4 minutes/2 = <<13minus4minute/2>>12 minute

39,"Sophie can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is two thirds as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 4 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends two thirds of the time running and one third of the time walking?","If Sophie can skip at two thirds the speed she can run, then she can run at 4*3/2=<<4*3/2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/2=3 miles per hour.
If one third of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*1/3=<<6*1/3=2>>2 hours.
If two thirds of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 hours.
Thus, she runs for 4 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 miles.
She walks for 2 hours at 3 miles per hour, or 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 24+6=<<24+6=30>>30 miles.
#### 30"," If she can skip at a ratio of rate of foot to rate of run, i is 1/2. Because each second is -1/2 of the distance it takes her to travel one unit, i is 1/4 in seconds. So she can run twice as fast as walking for every unit she’s skipped. So 62/60 + (4/60)*i = 63/60 + (i/4)*60. 62/60 + 63/60 + i = 42####

1165,Kenneth collects garbage from 5 different apartment complexes. The first four have 400 apartments each and the last one is 40% bigger than the other four combined. He collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.4 per collection for each apartment.

Number 5 has 1600*0.4=<<1600*0.4=640>>640 more apartments than those four combined.
So in total, it has 1600+640=<<1600+640=2240>>2240 apartments.
So in total, he goes to 2240+1600=<<2240+1600=3840>>3840 apartments each time
That means he visits 3840*5=<<3840*5=19,200>>19,200 apartments every week
