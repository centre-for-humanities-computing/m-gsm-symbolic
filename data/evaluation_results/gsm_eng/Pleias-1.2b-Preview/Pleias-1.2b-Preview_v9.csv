459,"A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of hay, wheats, beets and apples. Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys four 2-lb boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 12-lb bags. Hay are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty-two 60-lb packs. Wheats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1650 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 lbs of apples.
He is buying 6*12 = <<6*12=72>>72 lbs of beets.

He is buying 32*60 = <<32*60=1920>>1920 lbs of hay.
The weight of all the feed is 8 + 72 + 1300 + 1920 = <<8+72+1300+1920=3300>>3300 lbs.
Thus, the farmer needs 3300 / 1650 = <<3300/1650=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.

As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 20 pop in the first 12 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 12 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next 12 seconds, but in the final 12 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 12 seconds. After Ella takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 12 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat.

If there were 1500 unoccupied rooms in the medical center before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1500 rooms - 840 rooms = <<1500-840=660>>660 unoccupied rooms.

If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in eight hours if she spends one quarter of the time running and three quarters of the time walking?","If Anna can skip at three fifths the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*5/3=<<3*5/3=5>>5 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is five times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 5/5=1 miles per hour.
If three quarters of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 8*3/4=<<8*3/4=6>>6 hours.
If one quarter of the time is spent running, then she runs for 8-6=<<8-6=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 5 miles per hour, or 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 miles.
She walks for 6 hours at 1 miles per hour, or 6*1=<<6*1=6>>6 miles.

1084,"If David and Michael have 940 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Michael getting 160 yards more than David, how much is left over for David?","Let x be the amount of fence David gets and y be the amount Michael gets. We know that y = x + 160, and y + x = 940.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+160=940
Subtracting the 160 from both sides, we get 2x=780
We divide each side by two, leaving x=390. This means David has 390 yards of fence left over.
