How much money is Alex missing if he has $130 and the science fair costs $880?","Alex's community center has decided to pay 880*1/5=$<<880*1/5=176>>176 for his science fair.
In total Alex has covered 176 + 130 = $<<176+130=306>>306 for his science fair
Therefore, Alex needs 880 - 306 = $<<880-306=574>>574 more for the science fair.

Then multiply the amount one gnome can mine in a day with a titanium pickaxe by the number of gnomes: 13 pounds/day/gnome * 22 gnomes = <<13*22=297>>297 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 297 pounds/day * 30 days = <<297*30=8910>>8910 pounds/day

He only wants enough beets to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pounds bags. Wheats are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys forty-two 70-pounds packs.

He goes through 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 kilograms of rice a week
So he paid 6.9*21=€<<6.9*21=144>>144 on rice
That means his total bill was 144+2=€<<144+2=146>>146

The total cost for the rice was €6*<1.98/1=<<1.98/>1.98=2002>>2002
Then we use the figure 2002 to act as a variable while solving. The cost for the rice per kilogram was €6M/kg

Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 744 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<744/12=62>>62 foot.

#### 20"," The combined length of the remoras is 8 * 93 = 872 / 2 = 344 inches. The length of the whale is 310 / 3 = 90 inches. So 90% of the whale's body length is 860 / 2 = 510 inches.

How old was Carl when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"Carl saw the Comet for the second time when he was 39 years * 2= <<39*2=78>>78 years old.
Comet Hale-Bopp can be seen every 55 years, so Carl saw the comet for the first time when he was 78 years - 55 years = <<78-55=23>>23 years old.
#### 23"," The comet's orbital period is 55/2 = 169.5 days. Complete the following pattern with data supplied by Carl's father and your answer: {log10(269)*169.5} + {0*d[|1969}} * {1 if a[1969] = 1 }

1264,"Eric is popping popcorn for a snack. As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 40 pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to seven times the initial popping rate in the next 30 seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Eric takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Eric have to eat?","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3*40=<<3*40=120>>120 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 7*40=<<7*40=280>>280 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 280 / 2 = <<280/2=140>>140 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 140 / 4 = <<140/4=35>>35 kernels pop.
Thus, Eric has 40 + 120 + 280 + 140 + 35 = <<40+120+280+140+35=615>>615 pieces of popcorn to eat.
#### 615"," The number of kernels that begin to pop through the 120 seconds divided by the corresponding number of seconds is multiplied by \""N\"", the number of kernels, to find the number those kernels will bother the pupil: (N+1)^2 / N

989,Emily can peel 7 carrots a minute and saute 20 carrots in 20 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 140 carrots?,"First find how long it takes Emily to peel the carrots: 140 carrots / 7 carrots/minute = <<140/7=20>>20 minutes
Then find how many batches of carrots she needs to cook: 140 carrots / 20 carrots/batch = <<140/20=7>>7 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 7 batches * 20 minutes/batch = <<7*20=140>>140 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 140 minutes + 20 minutes = <<140+20=160>>160 minutes
#### 160"," She works 80 minutes to cook them, time spent peeling and sauteing is given a time interval of 2 hours/minute multiplied by slowing down twice (of a minute to a second): 80 min*70 = 570 min
She works 40 minutes during the first 7 minutes to do the work and then 41 minutes during the next 7 minutes:####

232,"Tyler went to their orchard to pick some strawberries and found one third as many bees as beetles in the plot. If there were 51 beetles, calculate the total number of insects in the plot.","If there were 51 beetles, the total number of bees in the plot is 1/3*51 beetles = 17 bees
The total number of insects in the plot is 17 bees + 51 beetles = <<17+51=68>>68 insects
#### 68"," In the orchard, there was 52% beetles as many as bees. In total, there were 310 plants with 52% bees. So, there were 52% of total plants with 52% of their bees. Since the orchard had 50% more ornamentals than plants, each ornamental had 51 % more bees as each plot of ornaments had 52% more bees.

930,"When Claire watches her cousin, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 68 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 16 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 26 multicolored rings on it. Claire recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her cousin up to 131. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Claire has 68 + 16 + 26 + T = 110 + T = 131 toys for her cousin.
Thus, T = 131 - 110 = <<131-110=21>>21 bouncy balls came in the tube.
#### 21"," The tube costing 26$ gives us 1 bottle of bouncy balls for each $ Surrounding 36 = <=[36, 41 = <= *26] The tube costs $26 = $<<26=560>>560
So Claire bought 131 * $560 = <<131*560=450>>450
Right hand side is the number of boxes that she bought, so children buying in the tube are removed.

158,"David went to buy some school supplies. He bought 10 colored pencils which cost €2.5 each, 8 crayons which cost €10.25 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost €16. How much did David spend on everything?","David spent 10*€2.5 = €<<10*2.5=25>>25 for the colored pencils.
He also spent 8*€10.25 = €<<8*10.25=82>>82 for the crayons.
Therefore, David spent a total of €25 + €82 + €16 = €<<25+82+16=123>>123 for the school supplies.
#### 123"," 40 pencils = €2.5 + €2.5 + 2.5 = €20.25 + €31.25 + 2.5 = €42.75 + €31.25 = €374.
45 pencils = €2.5 + €2.5 + 2.5 = €24.5 + €31.25 + 2.5 = €46.25 + €31.25 = €76.58
30 crayons = €10.25 + 2.5 = €12.25
Rim of bond paper = €16.

921,"A pizza has 36 servings. If Madison can eat 3 servings a day while Joe can eat five times as much, how many days will the pizza last?","Joe can eat 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 servings a day.
Together, Madison and Joe can eat 3 + 15 = <<3+15=18>>18 servings a day.
So, a pizza will last for 36/18 = <<36/18=2>>2 days.

On the sidewalk, Jessica walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 28-feet walk, in minutes?","On the beach, Jessica walks at a rate of 15 feets per 60 minutes, or 15/60 = 1/4 feets per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/4 = 0.5 feets per minute.
To walk 13 feet(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 13/0.5 = <<13/0.5=26>>26 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Jessica 60+26 = <<60+26=86>>86 minutes to walk her favorite route.

357,"Madison's aunt said that she had £190 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of laser tag, have £3 in game room tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of laser tag is £9. The go-karts cost £13 a ride. How many friends can she invite?","The go-karts will cost £26 per person because 13*2 = <<13*2=26>>26
Each person costs £38 because 3 + 9 + 26 = <<3+9+26=38>>38

39,"Olivia can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is two thirds as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 4 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking?","If Olivia can skip at two thirds the speed she can run, then she can run at 4*3/2=<<4*3/2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/2=3 miles per hour.
If half of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 4*1/2=<<4*1/2=2>>2 hours.
If half of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 2 hours at 3 miles per hour, or 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.
#### 18"," She must travel twice as fast as she can run, so the average velocity of running over a distance is twice as fast as the average velocity of walking over the same distance. Therefore, if she runs twice as fast as walking, she can walk twice as fast as walking, but walking at the same rate as fasten####
