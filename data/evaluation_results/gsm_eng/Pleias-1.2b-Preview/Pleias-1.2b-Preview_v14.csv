1088,There are 5 periods in the day for a normal student but Joe has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/4 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 classes a day

728,"Emma has 15 light purple spools of thread, 130 dark purple spools of thread, 60 light red spools of thread, and 50 dark red spools of thread. What percent of her spools are purple?","First find the number of purple spools: 15 spools + 130 spools = <<15+130=145>>145 spools
Then find the total number of spools: 60 spools + 50 spools + 145 spools = <<60+50+145=255>>255 spools
Then divide the number of purple spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 145 spools / 255 spools * 100% = 56%
#### 56"," Let x be the number of light purple spools. Since about 25% of all spools are spools of threads of one color, x/15 = <<x/15>=0.25>>0.25 threads of every 15 spools are dark purple. So we multiply x/15 by 0.25.
Next we multiply x/15 by 15: x*15 = 0.125 * 15 = <<0.125*15=0.75>>0.75 threads of every 15####

1084,"If Matt and Noah have 840 meters of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Noah getting 190 meters more than Matt, how much is left over for Matt?","Let x be the amount of fence Matt gets and y be the amount Noah gets. We know that y = x + 190, and y + x = 840.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+190=840
Subtracting the 190 from both sides, we get 2x=650
We divide each side by two, leaving x=325. This means Matt has 325 meters of fence left over.

How old was David when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"David saw the Comet for the second time when he was 21 years * 3= <<21*3=63>>63 years old.
Comet Encke can be seen every 60 years, so David saw the comet for the first time when he was 63 years - 60 years = <<63-60=3>>3 years old.

Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 24 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<24/12=2>>2 foot.
