661,Matt goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs £17 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 45% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 2 kg of rice per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for £4. How much did everything cost?,"The rice he bought was 17*0.45=£<<17*0.45=7>>7 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys
So it cost 17+7=£<<17+7=24>>24 per kg
He goes through 2*7=<<2*7=14>>14 kgs of rice a week
So he paid 24.65*14=£<<24.65*14=345>>345 on rice
That means his total bill was 345+4=£<<345+4=349>>349
#### 349"," Compared to the normal rice brand, the more expensive rice item costs 45% more. This means 2 * 45% = 1.45 times the price per kg of normal rice is needed to cover the cost of the extra chopping costs.

#### 1"," The difference between the cost of 5 loaves of sourdough and 3 bagels is 3* €0.01 = €02. The number of loaves is 5-0.01 = 4. So 4/5 of 3 at €0.01 = 2 loaves at €1.5 each
And how much does a bagel cost? A bagel costs €0.11 - €1.5 = €-0.44 = €0.66. €-0.44 divided by 3 minted for a loaf is €-0.44/3 =-#### 044400197419741994199419030304040505060607070808090909999999109090909090909090909090909090909090909090905101520253036100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007000000080011000110011000110011000110011000110011000111001100011000600000000000100100070010100000000000101001109999991200110112134556670000000000000007000000000010011000000050000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000001000000700000010100000009000000010100000100100000010001001000700100100110001100110001100110001100110001100110001100110001100110001101600111010300111011001110010021111014311111121210000000000000001000900500010110110100101010100110100010000000000000001001000700101000000000000001000000000010111000101000000010000000000110000000500000000000000010010011010000000000010021110010100100000007001010000000000010010010110008001000001001110001110000000000100000000000000000010010400101100000005000000000000000000000005001001011000000000010000000000101110001001700010010010011001000700010000000000100800101100000000010010000001001101010010100000101111000101000000080010000110010101100110001100000000110000000000000000000000000001001100010100000000001000000000000000000010010011010000001001051001000000000010111010110000000700000000000106700000016000011101100101111011011090888800054190809008100009001000000100",1.7375733780208975,False

And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 4/2=2 miles per hour.
If two thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*2/3=<<6*2/3=4>>4 hours.
If one third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 4 miles per hour, or 2*4=<<2*4=8>>8 miles.

184,Michael is rolling a 6-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 4 numbers greater than 2 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 4/6=66%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 66% - 25% = 41%.
#### 41"," There are 307 possible outcomes (2 coins on the die) for rolls that start on die face A (most likely). 
The probability that die face A will face down the die is 1/9.

Then find how many batches of clams she needs to cook: 60 clams / 20 clams/batch = <<60/20=3>>3 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 9 minutes/batch = <<3*9=27>>27 minutes

473,William saw a 20-foot dolphin with 4 3-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 3 inches/remora * 4 remoras = <<3*4=12>>12 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<12/12=1>>1 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 20 feet * 100% = 5%

#### 5"," The length of the dolphin's body is 20 + 4 * 3 = <<20+4*3=20>>20 bodylepnts
The length of the remoras is 4 * 20 = <<4*20<<
The average body-length length is >>4*3<<
The average = n*(20 + 3)
