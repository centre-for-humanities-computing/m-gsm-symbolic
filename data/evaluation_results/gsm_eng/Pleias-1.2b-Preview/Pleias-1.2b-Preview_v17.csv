If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in eight hours if she spends three quarters of the time running and one quarter of the time walking?","If Claire can skip at one third the speed she can run, then she can run at 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is four times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If one quarter of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 8*1/4=<<8*1/4=2>>2 hours.
If three quarters of the time is spent running, then she runs for 8-2=<<8-2=6>>6 hours.
Thus, she runs for 6 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36 miles.
She walks for 2 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 2*1.5=<<2*1.5=3>>3 miles.

If a 250 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ouncess can you eat if your daily calorie target is 1900 and you have already consumed 1000 calories?","If the total calorie target is 1900 and I have consumed 1000 calories then I have 1900-1000 = <<1900-1000=900>>900 calories left to eat
If each serving of breads has 450 calories and I only have 900 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 900/450 of a serving = 2 of a serving
We also know that a 250 ounces bag of breads has 5 servings, hence each serving has 250 ounces/5 = <<250/5=50>>50 ouncess
If I can only eat 2 of a serving, then I can eat only 50 ounces * 2 = 100 ouncess
#### 100"," A 250 ounces bag would require 3550 calories and consume 1000*1/2 = 600 calories. Since you already consumed 1000, 600 and thus have 1500 calories left, your daily calorie target is 1900*15=2300.
The current bag contains 1500 = 250 + 1500 = 3550.

989,Ava can peel 12 shrimp a minute and saute 20 shrimp in 16 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 120 shrimp?,"First find how long it takes Ava to peel the shrimp: 120 shrimp / 12 shrimp/minute = <<120/12=10>>10 minutes
Then find how many batches of shrimp she needs to cook: 120 shrimp / 20 shrimp/batch = <<120/20=6>>6 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 6 batches * 16 minutes/batch = <<6*16=96>>96 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Ava spends: 96 minutes + 10 minutes = <<96+10=106>>106 minutes
#### 106"," Assume Ava does not add any nutrients to the shrimp. Let N = number of shrimp to peel and Ava's per minute. So N*((12 shrimp/min*16 shrimp)/min) = <<N*((12 shrimp/min*16 shrimp)/min)<<15>>15 min = <<15 min<<120 shrimp>>120 shrimp.

1223,"To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay Â£0.5 for each minute of your call. After 28 minutes, that price drops to Â£0.2 per minute. How much would a 67-minute call cost?","First 28 minutes would be a cost of 28 * 0.5 = Â£<<28*0.5=14>>14.
After that, there are 67 - 28 = <<67-28=39>>39 minutes of the call left.
And these 39 minutes cost 39 * 0.2 = Â£<<39*0.2=7>>7.
So in total, the 67-minute call would cost 14 + 7 = Â£21.

If there were 1200 unoccupied beds in the clinic before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1200 beds - 420 beds = <<1200-420=780>>780 unoccupied beds.

1084,"If Maya and Noah have 800 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Noah getting 40 yards more than Maya, how much is left over for Maya?","Let x be the amount of fence Maya gets and y be the amount Noah gets. We know that y = x + 40, and y + x = 800.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+40=800
Subtracting the 40 from both sides, we get 2x=760
We divide each side by two, leaving x=380. This means Maya has 380 yards of fence left over.

Maya's 200= <<200=>>200 yards

1021,"In a 30-item quiz, 20% of the questions are geography, and the rest are equally divided as geometry and physics questions. If Jessica is sure to get 45% of the geography questions, and three quarters of the geometry and physics questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?","The geometry and physics questions comprises 100% - 20% = 80% of the quiz.
There are 30 questions*20/100 = <<30*20/100=6>>6 geography questions.
There are a total of 30 questions*80/100 = <<30*80/100=24>>24 geometry and physics questions.
If Jessica is sure to get 45% of the geography questions, then this means she is sure of her 6 questions*45/100 = <<6*45/100=2>>2 points.
From the geometry and physics questions, she is sure to get three quarters of it correctly so that is 24 questions*3/4 = <<24*3/4=18>>18 points.
Thus, she is sure of getting 2 points + 18 points = <<2+18=20>>20 points in her quiz.
#### 20"," The answer before any point dropped is 20% + three quarters = <<20%+3quarters=25%>>25%
The probability that Jessica correctly answers geography questions is 25%*90%/100% = <<25%*90%/100%=25%>>25%
The probability of three quarters of the geography questions correctly is 3/5 + 3/5 = <<3/5+3/5=7%>>7%

266,"Dr. Jones sold his villa for $830,000. He paid the registration fees that amount to 1% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 4% of the selling price. If he also paid $670,000 for the remaining loan amount of the villa, how much is Dr. Jones's net proceeds from selling the villa?","Dr. Jones paid $830,000*1/100 = $8300 for the registration fees.
He paid $830,000*4/100 = $33,200 for the realtor fee.
So, Dr. Jones paid a total of $8300 + $33,200 + $670,000 = $711,500 for the registration, realtor, and loan fees.
Hence, Dr. Jones's net proceeds is $830,000 - $711,500 = $118,500.
#### 118,500","
1) Dr. Jones paid $830,000 for the villa,
2) he paid the registration fees,
3) he paid the realtor fees of 1% and 4%,
4) he paid the remaining $670,000 for the loan.
Thus, the net proceeds are $830,000 = <<830,000>>= <<830,000>>

843,Eric has 3 â‚¬20 bills. He buys seven action figures for â‚¬5 each. He also buys 5 packs of erasers for â‚¬1 each. How much money does he have left?,"Eric starts off with 3 * â‚¬20 = â‚¬<<3*20=60>>60.
Eric spends 7*â‚¬5 = â‚¬<<7*5=35>>35 on action figures.
Eric spends 5 packs of erasers * â‚¬1 = â‚¬<<5*1=5>>5 on erasers.
Total Eric has spent â‚¬35 + â‚¬5 = â‚¬<<35+5=40>>40.
Eric has â‚¬60 - â‚¬40 = â‚¬<<60-40=20>>20 remaining.
#### 20"," Eric has 3*20=60 euros and 5 + 8-9*50=30 euro bills. Eric has still â‚¬60 but Eri has 60+30*7 = 94 euros..
