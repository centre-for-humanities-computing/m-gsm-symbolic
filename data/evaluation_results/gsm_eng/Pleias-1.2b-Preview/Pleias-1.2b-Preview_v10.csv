661,Carl goes to the store to buy some sugar. The normal brand of sugar he buys costs $7 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 10% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses 1 kg of sugar per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for $5. How much did everything cost?,"The sugar he bought was 7*0.1=$<<7*0.1=0>>0 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys
So it cost 7+0=$<<7+0=7>>7 per kg
He goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kgs of sugar a week
So he paid 7.7*7=$<<7.7*7=53>>53 on sugar
That means his total bill was 53+5=$<<53+5=58>>58
#### 58"," The cost of Carl's sugar can be divided into 70 periods, because every sugar period lasted to 20 minutes. The total cost of Charles' sugar period is 17-organ 7*10+8-organ 8=<17-organ 7*10+8-> ______

1099,"The biggest waterslide at Neptunes Kingdom is 300 yards long, and people slide down at 60 yards/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 260 yards long, but steeper, so people slide down at 65 yards/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?","First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 300 yards / 60 yards/minute = <<300/60=5>>5 minutes
Then find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 260 yards / 65 yards/minute = <<260/65=4>>4 minutes
Then subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 5 minutes - 4 minutes = <<5-4=1>>1 minutes
#### 1"," The biggest slide is 300+65=<<300+65=365>>365 yards long. For each slide, the steeper it gets, the longer it takes you to ride it. A distance of 365 yards is equivalent to a distance of 300 yards.
So the much longer of the two takes you eight minutes to ride the bigger slide.

184,Michael is rolling a 10-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 9 numbers greater than 1 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 9/10=90%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 90% - 25% = 65%.
#### 65"," Take the natural log of the decimal part. It's 10/1 in this case.
