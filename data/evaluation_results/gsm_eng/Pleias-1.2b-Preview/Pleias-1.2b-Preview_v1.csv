1031,"Oakwood High School is holding graduation in their Convention Center this year which has space for 4400 people. After accounting for 250 seats for graduates and 450 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 250 + 450 = <<250+450=700>>700 seats for faculty and graduates
Minus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 4400 - 700 = <<4400-700=3700>>3700 remaining seats.
Divide remaining seats by the number of graduates. 3700/250 = <<3700/250=14>>14 tickets

184,Noah is rolling a 10-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"There are 5 numbers greater than 5 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 5/10=50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

The remainder is neither 10 nor 20 (the left hand 7%), nor 100 (the higher weight in the right hand 2℅).
Therefore, we can calculate the probability of Noah rolling an even number in a row as the sum of the two aforementioned probabilities.

955,"A hospital has a capacity of 1800 beds with 1/12 occupied. Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.","If 1/12 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/12 * 1800 = <<1800*1/12=150>>150 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1800 beds - 150 beds = <<1800-150=1650>>1650 beds.
If 20 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 20 patients/day * 7 days/week = 140 patients.
After 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 140 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<140*2=280>>280 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 1650 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1650 beds - 280 beds = <<1650-280=1370>>1370 unoccupied beds.
#### 1370"," The previous two problems can be derived from this one except that the case of The hospital is considered by itself since the capacity isn't yet equal to the number of patients.

459,"A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of apples, hay, carrots and wheats. Since wheats are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-ounce boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-ounce bags. Apples are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty-four 70-ounce packs. Hay are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys eighteen 65-ounce sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1800 ounces at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 ounces of wheats.
He is buying 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 ounces of carrots.
He is buying 18*65 = <<18*65=1170>>1170 ounces of hay.
He is buying 34*70 = <<34*70=2380>>2380 ounces of apples.
The weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 1170 + 2380 = <<2+48+1170+2380=3600>>3600 ounces.
Thus, the farmer needs 3600 / 1800 = <<3600/1800=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.

Altogether, Ethan has 441 apples + 141 apples = <<441+141=582>>582 apples.

After half an hour, 130 people * 1/2 = <<130*1/2=65>>65 people left the party.
This means 130 people - 65 people = <<130-65=65>>65 people stayed.

1026,One troll can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe and 55% more with a mithril pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 20 trolls with mithril pickaxes mine in a month with 29 days?,"First find how much ore a troll can mine with an bronze pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day
Then multiply that amount by 155% to find how much a troll can mine with a mithril pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 155% = <<10*155*.01=15>>15 pounds/day
Then multiply the amount one troll can mine in a day with a mithril pickaxe by the number of trolls: 15 pounds/day/troll * 20 trolls = <<15*20=310>>310 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 310 pounds/day * 29 days = <<310*29=8990>>8990 pounds/day
#### 8990"," With bare hands, one troll can mine the same amount as a mithril pickaxe with 20 trolls, which is 5 x 20/20 = 1 pound each, because trolls mine the same amount is chess (5/10).

546,"Maya is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the hiragana (with 48 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full five times, writes one quarter of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Maya written in total?","Maya has written the hiragana (with 48 letters) five times which is a total of 48*5=<<48*5=240>>240 letters.
She then writes one quarter the hiragana (with 48 letters), which is 48*1/4=<<48*1/4=12>>12 letters.
So far, this is a total of 240 + 12 = <<240+12=252>>252 letters.
Writing this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 252 * 2 = <<252*2=504>>504 letters.
#### 504"," In the first time Maya wrote 24 letters, she writes 24/48 = <<24/48=56>>56, letters.
When she re-writes her first time, she adds one more, and you get 4*4 = 16 letters.

1133,"Maya walks 15 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 5 miles of walking on the beach and 10 mile(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Maya walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 15-mile walk, in minutes?","On the beach, Maya walks at a rate of 5 miles per 40 minutes, or 5/40 = 1/8 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/8 = 0.25 miles per minute.
To walk 10 mile(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 10/0.25 = <<10/0.25=40>>40 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Maya 40+40 = <<40+40=80>>80 minutes to walk her favorite route.
#### 80"," 40 minutes = <<40*2>>40 times the 60 minute rate of walking on the sidewalk, which is <<60*2>>60 of her walks always on the beach.
So, the entire 15-mile walk, in minutes, will require <<40 minutes*60 minutes=140 minutes>>140 minutes, which, multiplied by 60 minutes, equals <<140 min*60 min=5 min>>####

1165,Chris collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. The first two have 150 apartments each and the last one is 25% bigger than the other two combined. He collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.2 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?,"The first two complexes have 2*150=<<2*150=300>>300 apartments
Number 3 has 300*0.25=<<300*0.25=75>>75 more apartments than those two combined.
So in total, it has 300+75=<<300+75=375>>375 apartments.
So in total, he goes to 375+300=<<375+300=675>>675 apartments each time
That means he visits 675*5=<<675*5=3375>>3375 apartments every week
So he makes 3375*€0.2=€<<3375*0.2=675>>675 every week
