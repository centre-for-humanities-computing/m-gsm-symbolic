1165,Noah collects garbage from 6 different apartment complexes. The first five have 400 apartments each and the last one is 45% bigger than the other five combined. He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.25 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?,"The first five complexes have 5*400=<<5*400=2000>>2000 apartments
Number 6 has 2000*0.45=<<2000*0.45=900>>900 more apartments than those five combined.
So in total, it has 2000+900=<<2000+900=2900>>2900 apartments.
So in total, he goes to 2900+2000=<<2900+2000=4900>>4900 apartments each time
That means he visits 4900*3=<<4900*3=14,700>>14,700 apartments every week
So he makes 14,700*€0.25=€<<14,700*0.25=3675>>3675 every week
#### 3675"," By accumulating garbage for each separate apartment complex, he accumulates 6*5*3*0.25=<<6*5*3*0.25=≥500><520*0.25=≥800>>800 pesos.
His daily income is 800*3*1=<<800*3*1=≥2000><2004*1=≥4000>>4000 pesos.
The daily total income is 2000+4000+2004+3+800+0.25=<<2000+4000+2004+3+800+0.25=≥300000><330000*####

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?","If Sarah can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 4/2=2 miles per hour.
If two thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*2/3=<<6*2/3=4>>4 hours.
If one third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 4 miles per hour, or 2*4=<<2*4=8>>8 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 2 miles per hour, or 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 8+8=<<8+8=16>>16 miles.

788,"David is raising money for a science fair. He has applied for help from the parent association, which has decided to cover one fifth of the cost of the science fair. How much money is David missing if he has £180 and the science fair costs £790?","David's parent association has decided to pay 790*1/5=£<<790*1/5=158>>158 for his science fair.
In total David has covered 158 + 180 = £<<158+180=338>>338 for his science fair
Therefore, David needs 790 - 338 = £<<790-338=452>>452 more for the science fair.
#### 452"," The odd trick is to double David's deficiency. We will make £180 to cover the scholarship, and do the odd trick by doubling David's deficiency (making £180*0.5=<<180*0.5=60>>60).
