125,"Ashley was preparing for a birthday party at her house, where she intended to serve beef stew. She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons. Later, her husband also bought a package of 6 new spoons and gave them to Ashley. While Ashley was making the beef stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her beef stew. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 14 spoons. How many spoons were in the package that Ashley bought?","The total number of spoons from Ashley and her husband was 14+3=<<14+3=17>>17 spoons.

1165,Kenneth collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. The first two have 200 apartments each and the last one is 65% bigger than the other two combined. He collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.30000000000000004 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?,"The first two complexes have 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 apartments
Number 3 has 400*0.65=<<400*0.65=260>>260 more apartments than those two combined.
So in total, it has 400+260=<<400+260=660>>660 apartments.
So in total, he goes to 660+400=<<660+400=1060>>1060 apartments each time
That means he visits 1060*2=<<1060*2=2120>>2120 apartments every week
So he makes 2120*€0.30000000000000004=€<<2120*0.30000000000000004=636>>636 every week
#### 636"," Kenneth has to collect 551 containers of discarded trash from these apartment complexes.
He collects it 2 times a week, so 2*2*0.30000000 = <<2*2*0.30000000=60>>60 containers.
He collects it for 8 hours per week (59 days *2 weeks * 2 days = 288 hours total effort).

From the literature and algebra questions, she is sure to get one quarter of it correctly so that is 56 questions*1/4 = <<56*1/4=14>>14 points.

Then find the amount of the first price increase: £340 * 0.8 = £<<340*0.8=272>>272

   - How does this cash transfer increase the value?

184,Ethan is rolling a d6 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 4 numbers greater than 2 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 4/6=66%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 66% - 25% = 41%.
#### 41"," We know that (2m+1) % (m + 1) = <<(2m+1)*(m+1)>
We know that the result of the first step is (2m+1) % (m + 1) = <<o(2m+1)*(m+1)>
For the second step, if m gets rolled and rolled over, we conclude that (2go+1)%go = <<(2go+1)*go>>
Then we have (2go+1) % (go+go+1) = <<(2go+1)*go>>

579,A student has 15 stickers. His brother has 7 fewer stickers than he has. How many stickers do they have together?,"His brother has 15 - 7 = <<15-7=8>>8 stickers.
Together, they have 15 + 8 = <<15+8=23>>23 stickers.
#### 23"," The student has a total of x = <<x=15>>15 (15 - 7) = <<15-7=8>>8 stickers.
The brother has a total of x' = <<x'=7>>7 (7 - x) = <<7-7=0>>0 stickers.
So the brother has a total of x-x' = <<x-x'=8>>8 - 0 = <<8-0=8>>8 stickers.
So the total is 4 stickers.

After 4 weeks, Abby and Ava compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Abby has 22 signatures in her book, and Ava has 40. The sisters have 3 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 125 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?","Abby and Ava have already collected 22 + 40 signatures = <<22+40=62>>62 signatures.
Since their goal is 125, they need to collect 125 - 62 signatures. 125 - 62 = <<125-62=63>>63 signatures
#### 63"," To reach the goal, we need to count what exactly 424+244+244, and then sum it to 100. Then we will have 12*100 = <<12*100=1200>>1200 objects.

661,Noah goes to the store to buy some flour. The normal brand of flour he buys costs £20 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 30% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 1 kilogram of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for £5. How much did everything cost?,"The flour he bought was 20*0.3=£<<20*0.3=6>>6 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys
So it cost 20+6=£<<20+6=26>>26 per kilogram
He goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kilograms of flour a week
So he paid 26*7=£<<26*7=182>>182 on flour
That means his total bill was 182+5=£<<182+5=187>>187
#### 187"," The normal brand of flour costs £20/kg. Once a kilo (lkg) is consumed, then it costs £0.2/kg = <<(20/kg)*0.2=2>>2 kg. By buying a more expensive brand, it costs 1.1 / 2 = «(80/80)-«20/80=3130»>3130kg.

991,Comet Hyakutake orbits the sun every 55 years. Ethan's uncle saw the Comet when he was 46 years old. Ethan saw the comet a second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he saw the Comet. How old was Ethan when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"Ethan saw the Comet for the second time when he was 46 years * 2= <<46*2=92>>92 years old.
Comet Hyakutake can be seen every 55 years, so Ethan saw the comet for the first time when he was 92 years - 55 years = <<92-55=37>>37 years old.
#### 37"," For the first time, Ethan saw the Comet suddenly when his uncle was 46 years old. His uncle was 55 years old when he saw the Comet the first time, so Ethan's age when he saw the comet was 55 / (2 * 46)=<<55/((2+1)/2)*46=7>>7 years.
In conclusion, the better approach is to use a downward approach.

1207,"Bob caught 5 steelheads last Wednesday, the first steelhead he caught weighs 71 kgs, the second steelhead he caught weighs 53 kgs, and the remaining steelhead he caught weighs 32 kgs. If a kg of steelhead costs £2.5, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?","Bob will earn 71*£2.5 = £<<71*2.5=177.5>>177.5 from the first steelhead.
He will earn 53*£2.5 = £<<53*2.5=132.5>>132.5 for the second steelhead.
The rest of the steelheads are 5-2 = <<5-2=3>>3. He will earn 32*£2.5 = £<<32*2.5=80>>80 per each of them. So he will earn 3 * 80 = <<3*80>>=240
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the steelheads is £177.5 + £132.5 + £240= £<<177.5+132.5+240=550>>550.
#### 550"," The market price of steelhead per kg is 70 (151.7 - 71) S, this is the total amount he will earn after selling all the steelheads. The total amount he earns is 70 - (0.02) = <<70-0.02=71>>71 pounds.
