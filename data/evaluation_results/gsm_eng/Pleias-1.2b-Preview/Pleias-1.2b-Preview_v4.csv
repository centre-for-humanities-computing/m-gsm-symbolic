184,Ethan is rolling a 12-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 11 numbers greater than 1 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 11/12=91%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 91% - 25% = 66%.
#### 66"," The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 1 - e2. So its probability is 1 - e-2. This is true for the probability that Ethan rolls a number greater than 1, but also true for a number twice as large as 1.

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends one quarter of the time running and three quarters of the time walking?","If Sophia can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 12/2=6 miles per hour.
If three quarters of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 4*3/4=<<4*3/4=3>>3 hours.
If one quarter of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-3=<<4-3=1>>1 hours.
Thus, she runs for 1 hours at 12 miles per hour, or 1*12=<<1*12=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 3 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 3*6=<<3*6=18>>18 miles.

473,Jessica saw a 180-foot dolphin with 8 54-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 54 inches/remora * 8 remoras = <<54*8=432>>432 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 432 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<432/12=36>>36 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 36 foot / 180 feet * 100% = 20%

#### 20", The combined length of the remoras is described as a percentage of the dolphin's body length as: 54.79% of the dolphin's 80-centimeter (27-inch) body length. The dolphin's body length is 80 centimeters (ca. 27.5 inches) and the length of each remora is 54 centimeters (ca. 15.7 inches).

1021,"In a 120-item quiz, 55% of the questions are physics, and the rest are equally divided as economics and biology questions. If Ava is sure to get 15% of the physics questions, and one third of the economics and biology questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?","The economics and biology questions comprises 100% - 55% = 45% of the quiz.
There are 120 questions*55/100 = <<120*55/100=66>>66 physics questions.
There are a total of 120 questions*45/100 = <<120*45/100=53>>53 economics and biology questions.
If Ava is sure to get 15% of the physics questions, then this means she is sure of her 66 questions*15/100 = <<66*15/100=9>>9 points.
From the economics and biology questions, she is sure to get one third of it correctly so that is 53 questions*1/3 = <<53*1/3=17>>17 points.
Thus, she is sure of getting 9 points + 17 points = <<9+17=26>>26 points in her quiz.
#### 26"," 55% of the 120 questions are physics questions so that's 0.05*120 = <<0.05*120=40>>40 points.

1053,"Ellen qualified for a spot on the cycling team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a t-shirt for €25, a pair of cycling shorts for €13 more than the t-shirt cost, and a pair of sneakers that were originally €42 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for €2 off the package of €6 athletic headbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?","The shorts were €13 more than the t-shirt, so they cost €13 + €25 = €<<13+25=38>>38.
Her sneakers were half the original €42 price, so they cost €42*1/2=€21.
With her coupon, the headbands were €6 - €2 = €<<6-2=4>>4.
