39,"Ellen can run four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is one quarter as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?","If Ellen can skip at one quarter the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is four times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 12/4=3 miles per hour.
If two thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*2/3=<<6*2/3=4>>4 hours.
If one third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 12 miles per hour, or 2*12=<<2*12=24>>24 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 3 miles per hour, or 4*3=<<4*3=12>>12 miles.

459,"A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of oats, apples, beets and corns. Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-ounce boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 8-ounce bags. Oats are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty-two 65-ounce packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys eighteen 65-ounce sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1650 ounces at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 ounces of corns.

Then multiply that amount by 170% to find how much a goblin can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 170% = <<10*170*.01=17>>17 pounds/day
Then multiply the amount one goblin can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of goblins: 17 pounds/day/goblin * 20 goblins = <<17*20=340>>340 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 340 pounds/day * 28 days = <<340*28=9520>>9520 pounds/day

Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 84 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<84/12=7>>7 foot.

The second biggest waterslide is 300 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 85 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?","First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 380 meters / 80 meters/minute = <<380/80=4>>4 minutes
Then find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 300 meters / 85 meters/minute = <<300/85=3>>3 minutes
Then subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 4 minutes - 3 minutes = <<4-3=1>>1 minutes

265,"Ms. Johnson is looking for a townhouse that will not go beyond her $370,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $340,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 13% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the townhouse than Ms. Johnson's budget?","The brokerage fee is $340,000*3/100 = $<<340,000*3/100=10,200>>10,200.
The transfer fee is $340,000*13/100 = $<<340,000*13/100=44,200>>44,200.
The total price of the townhouse is $340,000 + $10,200 + $44,200 = $394,400.
So, it is $394,400 - $370,000 = $<<394,400-370,000=24,400>>24,400 more than Ms. Johnson's budget.
#### 24,400"," Ms. Johnson's budget: a buying price of $340,000 / 3% = $19,000. The transaction fee: a selling price of $340,000 * 13% = $7,000. Total selling price: selling price of $340,000 * 3% = $19,000 + $7,000 = $26,000.
The little townhouse: the selling price of $340,000 + $7,000 = $347,000.

991,Comet Encke orbits the sun every 50 years. Matt's dad saw the Comet when he was 28 years old. Matt saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his dad was when he saw the Comet. How old was Matt when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"Matt saw the Comet for the second time when he was 28 years * 3= <<28*3=84>>84 years old.
Comet Encke can be seen every 50 years, so Matt saw the comet for the first time when he was 84 years - 50 years = <<84-50=34>>34 years old.
