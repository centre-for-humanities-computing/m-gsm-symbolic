And keep scale away from students because they are going to be eating the last brownies.
And, because they will not be rolling them into balls, since they are going to be eating them.
Looks like we need to put the scale away.

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends one quarter of the time running and three quarters of the time walking?","If Sophia can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 12/2=6 miles per hour.

If one quarter of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-3=<<4-3=1>>1 hours.
Thus, she runs for 1 hours at 12 miles per hour, or 1*12=<<1*12=12>>12 miles.

677,"Emma and Sophie are sisters from Dallas who love collecting signatures from musicians. During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 8 weeks, Emma and Sophie compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Emma has 25 signatures in her book, and Sophie has 43. The sisters have 4 more weeks of summer break, and they decide they want to reach 105 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?","Emma and Sophie have already collected 25 + 43 signatures = <<25+43=68>>68 signatures.
Since their goal is 105, they need to collect 105 - 68 signatures. 105 - 68 = <<105-68=37>>37 signatures
#### 37"," Emma begins with 25 signatures and she and Sophie add 8 signatures. Emma and Sophie exchange signatures but only after the 8 signatures have been added. This means that Emma and Sophie also exchange 8 signatures, meaning they will take on 25 and then 0. What does this mean for their goals?

If Ava is sure to get 15% of the physics questions, then this means she is sure of her 66 questions*15/100 = <<66*15/100=9>>9 points.
From the economics and biology questions, she is sure to get one third of it correctly so that is 53 questions*1/3 = <<53*1/3=17>>17 points.
Thus, she is sure of getting 9 points + 17 points = <<9+17=26>>26 points in her quiz.
#### 26"," If Ava knows that 1/3 of her physics test will have questions. 14*3 = 60 Pins of maximum value, 0.90*60 = <<0.90*60=28>>28. Half of the other questions will have a chance of failing. $(25-14)=18-27=3$$. So 18/27 = 0.60 * 68/68=0.60 * 68 is the answer in the correct answer order.

400,A cup of soda is 9 ounces of soda. Ethan drinks 6 cups of soda. If soda has 8 calories per ounce how many calories did he consume?,"He drank 9*6=<<9*6=54>>54 ounces of soda.
So he drank 54*8=<<54*8=432>>432 calories of soda
#### 432"," Ethan's soda had 8 calories per ounce, since excess calories are calories burned. Therefore, he consumed 16 oz. = 2/3.64 → = 0.64.

459,"A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of oats, corns, beets and hay. Since hay are a rare treat, he only buys four 2-lb boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 12-lb bags. Oats are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys thirty-two 60-lb packs. Corns are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys twenty 50-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1500 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 lbs of hay.
He is buying 6*12 = <<6*12=72>>72 lbs of beets.
He is buying 20*50 = <<20*50=1000>>1000 lbs of corns.
He is buying 32*60 = <<32*60=1920>>1920 lbs of oats.
The weight of all the feed is 8 + 72 + 1000 + 1920 = <<8+72+1000+1920=3000>>3000 lbs.
Thus, the farmer needs 3000 / 1500 = <<3000/1500=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.
#### 2"," Having a farm truck with a capacity to transport 2,400 lbs can be inconvenient for the farmer. He doesn't mind dropping the animals on Friday afternoon and making only one delivery of the feed, so that 4,000 lbs can fit, or he can deliver 800 lbs at once for one trip which leaves 2,600 lbs in the p#### 13501154749984949575821155421818388343525592152255349349343521511233094830830965734113943366576374186947550425503037968186963294991869185241487220285553906551853841070353956333925535533469625381222665191345794334959193090731860752636347718204599439449822335283142199282995252402400354225521492620830872857625199826279952251681821592262739105303123411256287728219745583844531301171224732176248398175184844132429192422536301376707145538924824608403634438363378203584233187268074775143843276216518456372562566789282457545755755998591568343786762978518372452680033976524785422358331528982313260620073682466029898128287556716230832621936395061668783421524883382352485274189738232453452726493209189961988762226522832142842795722764593816112117824423852652673136092223526523815682875214328286345509305359322651376325594231833878136341805460379138092951916891330872192841885153201313526144021612377719508952771943240418561255340334146289516651843954038375543397671866891324853533588537895134286058378682187415288414253114122959325352627177376495514",1.4129259410547093,False
