184,Chris is rolling a d20 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"There are 18 numbers greater than 2 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 18/20=90%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 90% - 25% = 65%.
#### 65"," When rolling die, to get any chance of rolling a one or two, you have to have as many compartments as you did one out of two rolls. So the chance of rolling two numbers of the same size a row is (0.34*0.34= <<0.34>>0.34) % of two, or in other words is 0.12% of 2.

He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 12-lb bags. Oats are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys forty 75-lb packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys eighteen 45-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1950 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 lbs of hay.

If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in eight hours if she spends three quarters of the time running and one quarter of the time walking?","If Jessica can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 12/2=6 miles per hour.

If three quarters of the time is spent running, then she runs for 8-2=<<8-2=6>>6 hours.
