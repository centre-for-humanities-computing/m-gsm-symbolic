873,Chris has €80.5517098445596 and wants to buy 15 washers from a bin at the hardware store. Each washer costs €0.98. How much money does Chris have left after paying for the washers?,"Chris paid 15 * €0.98 = €<<15*0.98=14.7>>14.7 for the washers.
Chris has €80.5517098445596 - €14.7 = €65 left.
#### 65"," €80.5517098445596 + 105 = 160.0036.
And keep scale: /2 * 4.2 * 160  = 5.0526...
Now: / 2 x 4.2 * 160 = 105
Will this always work? Never. Works almost all of the time. ???
If the answer is no, then I told you it was a Fibonacci!
So the answer is false if there is a decimal in the denominator!

473,Madison saw a 200-foot dolphin with 6 20-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 20 inches/remora * 6 remoras = <<20*6=120>>120 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 120 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<120/12=10>>10 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 10 foot / 200 feet * 100% = 5%

If each serving of breads has 175 calories and I only have 350 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 350/175 of a serving = 2 of a serving
We also know that a 300 ounces bag of breads has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300 ounces/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 ouncess

459,"A farmer is buying feed for his sheep. He buys a variety of hay, corns, carrots and wheats. Since wheats are a rare treat, he only buys six 3-lb boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 12-lb bags. Hay are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys forty-two 75-lb packs. Corns are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys sixteen 60-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2100 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 lbs of wheats.

He is buying 16*60 = <<16*60=960>>960 lbs of corns.
He is buying 42*75 = <<42*75=3150>>3150 lbs of hay.
The weight of all the feed is 18 + 72 + 960 + 3150 = <<18+72+960+3150=4200>>4200 lbs.

If she can skip at 4 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends two thirds of the time running and one third of the time walking?","If Sophie can skip at two thirds the speed she can run, then she can run at 4*3/2=<<4*3/2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/2=3 miles per hour.
If one third of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*1/3=<<6*1/3=2>>2 hours.
If two thirds of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 hours.
Thus, she runs for 4 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 miles.
She walks for 2 hours at 3 miles per hour, or 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 24+6=<<24+6=30>>30 miles.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 4% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 14% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the apartment than Mrs. Lee's budget?","The brokerage fee is $290,000*4/100 = $<<290,000*4/100=11,600>>11,600.
The transfer fee is $290,000*14/100 = $<<290,000*14/100=40,600>>40,600.
The total price of the apartment is $290,000 + $11,600 + $40,600 = $342,200.

He paid $600,000*4/100 = $24,000 for the realtor fee.
So, Mr. Davis paid a total of $6000 + $24,000 + $530,000 = $560,000 for the legal, realtor, and loan fees.

184,Oliver is rolling a 8-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"There are 6 numbers greater than 2 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 6/8=75%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 75% - 25% = 50%.
#### 50"," If the die is 6 sides and 2 of them have 2 numbers drawn 8 times in a row, 11 and 7 times in the other ones, the underwater wave that all of those 1's would have generated would be 4. If 8 numbers are thrown then the 21st number thrown would be 16 (double the 11's squared). 16 * 16/1234 is 2. So 0.####

1223,"To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay €0.75 for each minute of your call. After 18 minutes, that price drops to €0.5 per minute. How much would a 85-minute call cost?","First 18 minutes would be a cost of 18 * 0.75 = €<<18*0.75=13>>13.
