473,Emma saw a 60-foot shark with 4 36-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 36 inches/remora * 4 remoras = <<36*4=144>>144 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 144 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<144/12=12>>12 foot.

So far, this is a total of 96 + 16 = <<96+16=112>>112 letters.

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+20=240
Subtracting the 20 from both sides, we get 2x=220
We divide each side by two, leaving x=110. This means Emma has 110 feet of fence left over.
#### 110"," If Emma's length of fence is equal to Anna's length of fence, then Emma's length = Anna's length, so Emma's area of fence = Anna's length * Anna's length.
Therefore, Emma's area of fence = 2*240*240/60 = 512^2 = 64^2=16.

456,"In a set of magician's cards, there are 62 orange cards, and 51% more green cards. Red cards are as many as the sum of orange and green cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?","There are 51/100 * 62 = <<51/100*62=31>>31 more green cards than orange cards.
Which means there are 62 + 31 = <<62+31=93>>93 green cards.
Red cards make up to 62 + 93 = <<62+93=155>>155 cards.
So in total, there are 155 + 155 = <<155+155=310>>310 cards of different colors.
#### 310","In a set of magician's cards, there are 62 orange cards, 51% more green cards.

Therefore,red cards are as many as orange cards.
There are 27 green and 22 orange cards in the set of magician's cards.

So in total, he goes to 390+300=<<390+300=690>>690 apartments each time
That means he visits 690*2=<<690*2=1380>>1380 apartments every week
So he makes 1380*€0.35000000000000003=€<<1380*0.35000000000000003=483>>483 every week

937,"Carl is feeding his livestock grain. Each goat needs 10 pounds, and each cow needs 9 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. If there are 25 goats and 27 cows, how many pounds of grain does Carl need?","First figure out how much grain each cow needs: 10 pounds * 2 - 9 = <<10*2-9=11>>11 pounds/cow
Now figure out how much grain total the cows need: 11 pounds/cow * 27 cows = <<11*27=297>>297 pounds
Now figure out how much grain total the goats need: 10 pounds/goat * 25 goats = <<10*25=250>>250 pounds
Now add the two amounts of grain to find the total: 297 pounds + 250 pounds = <<297+250=547>>547 pounds
#### 547"," The total number of pounds of grain is 25**2/(25+27)=32.2

Chris spent $9.4 because 10 - 0.6 = <<10-0.6=9.4>>9.4
Chris spent $4.9 on pretzels because 7*0.7 = <<7*0.7=4.9>>4.9
Chris spent 4.5 on gum because 9.4 - 4.9 = <<9.4-4.9=4.5>>4.5
Chris bought 6 gum because 4.5 / 0.75 = <<6=6>>6
