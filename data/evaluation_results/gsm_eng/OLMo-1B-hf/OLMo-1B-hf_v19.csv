737,"Eric wants to make different sized ice cubes with 76 ozs of water. He can make giant cubes that use 5 ozs per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ozs, and small cubes that use 1/2 oz. If he makes 7 giant cubes, 12 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many ozs of water does he have left?","The giant cubes used up 35 ozs of water because 7 times 5 equals <<7*5=35>>35.
The medium cubes used up 24 ozs of water because 12 times 2 equals <<12*2=24>>24.
The small cubes used up 4 ozs of water because 8 times 1/2 equals 4.
This means that Eric has used up 63 ozs of water because 35 plus 24 plus 4 equals 63.
Eric has 13 ozs of water left because 76 minus 63 equals <<76-63=13>>13.
#### 13"," I have already explained how Eric robertates his water to get seven small cubes, it totals to 7*12*12*1/2*3=<<74>>74 ounces.
Therefore, to determine Eric needs/product needs in ice cubes, if he needs/product needs 10 oz he will need to pour (10 - 8) * 20 ozs each = <<500>>500 ounces.

Find the combined total of the number of pears and grapes Alex has in the house?","Before buying any pear and grape, Alex had four times as many pears as grapes, which is 55 grapes*4 pear/grape = <<55*4=220>>220 pears
The total number of pears and grapes that Alex had before is 220 pears + 55 grapes = <<220+55=275>>275 items
When he bought 22 fewer pears than grapes, he bought 48 pears - 22 pears = <<48-22=26>>26 pears
In total, he bought 26 pears + 48 grapes = <<26+48=74>>74 items
After the purchases, Alex has 275 items + 74 items = <<275+74=349>>349 total pears and grapes combined.
#### 349"," Alex has 50 grapes in the house. For ((55-(48-13))/2 = 48/2) = 8/9 = 47/9 grapes in the house.
Val: subtracting 47/9 from the total of 49 will just equal 47/9. The remainder of the number divisible by a multiple of 9 is 49/9. So (49/9) = 47/9, or 47 is divisible by (9/9) = 1/9.

410,"Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $39 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $5 per pound, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" She scooped up 4 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $4.0 and 6 magnets that were $2.25 each. How much money does Sally have left?","Sally is buying 1 pound for $5 and gets 1 pound 1/2 off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $5*1/2 = $2.5. The rest of 2 pound does not have discount and costs 2*$5 = $10, so total is $5+$5/2+$10=$35/2
6 magnets at $2.25 each is 6*2.25=$<<6*2.25=13.5>>13.5
When you add all her purchases, 35/2+$4+$13.5 = $<<35/2+4+13.5=35>>35
She had $39 and spent $35 so she had $39-$35 = $<<39-35=4>>4 left over
#### 4"," Her total was 85 euros + 27 euros + 35 euros + 62 euros = 346.

Her expenses - total spent =: 346 - TOTAL SPENT = 342.05.
