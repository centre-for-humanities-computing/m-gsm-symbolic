546,"Emily is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the arabic abjad (with 28 letters) until she knows it.

She then writes three quarters the arabic abjad (with 28 letters), which is 28*3/4=<<28*3/4=21>>21 letters.
So far, this is a total of 84 + 21 = <<84+21=105>>105 letters.
Writing this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 105 * 2 = <<105*2=210>>210 letters.
#### 210"," Because Emily has edited when she published the tests, we know that the first time she tried is to write 47, the second to write 44. Then she pens for 56, 59, 55, 55, 50, 48, 48, 47, 47, 46 and 32. So Emily wrote 9,25 å, 5 2/3!ã, 13 4/5 2 1/3, 3 1/2 2/3 2/3 and 4/5 1/3 å.

If a kilogram of trout costs £2.5, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?","Carl will earn 76*£2.5 = £<<76*2.5=190>>190 from the first trout.
He will earn 32*£2.5 = £<<32*2.5=80>>80 for the second trout.
The rest of the trouts are 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5. He will earn 27*£2.5 = £<<27*2.5=67.5>>67.5 per each of them. So he will earn 5 * 67.5 = <<5*67.5>>=337.5
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is £190 + £80 + £337.5= £<<190+80+337.5=607>>607.

Carl doesn't earn money, he only buys the trouts. He sells them to the market for £2.5 per kilo.
