1207,"Henry caught 7 tunes last Tuesday, the first tune he caught weighs 64 kilograms, the second tune he caught weighs 41 kilograms, and the remaining tune he caught weighs 20 kilograms. If a kilogram of tune costs $1.0, how much will he earn after selling all the tunes to the market?","Henry will earn 64*$1 = $<<64*1=64>>64 from the first tune.
He will earn 41*$1 = $<<41*1=41>>41 for the second tune.
The rest of the tunes are 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5. He will earn 20*$1 = $<<20*1=20>>20 per each of them. So he will earn 5 * 20 = <<5*20>>=100
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunes is $64 + $41 + $100= $<<64+41+100=205>>205.
#### 205"," Henry catches 70 whole snails, aka 66 + 2 = 74 snails. Each snail scale weighs <2.5 × 10−7 of the last ticket purchased. So, the purchase of 2 tickets with a price of 1.0 = 2 × 65536 = 74 × 65536 (0.16) ≈ 3420 snails. After selling 3420 snails, he has $0.0493 ≈ 1546 coins.

1223,"To make a call from a phone booth, you must pay £0.75 for each minute of your call. After 20 minutes, that price drops to £0.25 per minute. How much would a 87-minute call cost?","First 20 minutes would be a cost of 20 * 0.75 = £<<20*0.75=15>>15.
After that, there are 87 - 20 = <<87-20=67>>67 minutes of the call left.
And these 67 minutes cost 67 * 0.25 = £<<67*0.25=16>>16.
So in total, the 87-minute call would cost 15 + 16 = £31.
#### 31"," Divide the call duration into 20 minutes (87~0.25), then multiply by 20 to get the remaining total hours. 87x20 = ~1,072 hours.
Thus, for a 87-minute call, it would cost £9.07.

If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?","If Sarah can skip at three quarters the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*4/3=<<3*4/3=4>>4 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 4/2=2 miles per hour.

If one third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.

He only wants enough beets to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 8-pounds bags. Oats are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys thirty-eight 55-pounds packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys seventeen 50-pounds sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1500 poundss at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 poundss of hay.

Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.","If 1/10 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/10 * 1300 = <<1300*1/10=130>>130 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1300 beds - 130 beds = <<1300-130=1170>>1170 beds.
If 30 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 30 patients/day * 7 days/week = 210 patients.
After 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 210 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<210*2=420>>420 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 1170 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1170 beds - 420 beds = <<1170-420=750>>750 unoccupied beds.

So that means 26 balls left to sell.

184,Michael is rolling a 6-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 4 numbers greater than 2 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 4/6=66%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 66% - 25% = 41%.
#### 41"," Approximately 70% - 30%
To represent the problem in base-2, the relative frequency given by the language is approximately 6:4. This means that in a ratio of 6:4, it is 6 times more likely to roll 5~6 than 2. The base2 value of the fraction representing Michael rolls 6 is written as 0.347.049. The p####

She scooped up 7 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.0 and 8 magnets that were $1.75 each. How much money does Sally have left?","Sally is buying 1 pound for $1 and gets 1 pound 1/3 off. So 1/3 off of 1 pound is $1*1/3 = $0.3333333333333333. The rest of 5 pound does not have discount and costs 5*$1 = $5, so total is $1+$2/3+$5=$20/3
8 magnets at $1.75 each is 8*1.75=$<<8*1.75=14>>14
When you add all her purchases, 20/3+$1+$14 = $<<20/3+1+14=21>>21

1084,"If Kenneth and Maya have 480 meters of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Maya getting 20 meters more than Kenneth, how much is left over for Kenneth?","Let x be the amount of fence Kenneth gets and y be the amount Maya gets. We know that y = x + 20, and y + x = 480.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+20=480
Subtracting the 20 from both sides, we get 2x=460
We divide each side by two, leaving x=230. This means Kenneth has 230 meters of fence left over.
#### 230"," If the ratio of the total meter covered by each includes 0, then it should be rounded off to the nearest whole number
They should negotiate a 60/40 percent split of the fence

Together, Joe and Emily can eat 3 + 6 = <<3+6=9>>9 servings a day.
So, a pie will last for 18/9 = <<18/9=2>>2 days.
#### 2"," If I always eat 3 servings a day, then that means that I eat 18 * 3 = 54 servings of pie a day. It lasts 54 days.
Joe can eat 5 servings a day, which gives him a total of 55 servings after 54 days.

Then find how many batches of clams she needs to cook: 60 clams / 20 clams/batch = <<60/20=3>>3 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 9 minutes/batch = <<3*9=27>>27 minutes
