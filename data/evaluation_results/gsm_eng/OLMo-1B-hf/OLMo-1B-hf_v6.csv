1026,One miner can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe and 40% more with a bronze pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe. How many kgs of ore can 20 miners with bronze pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?,"First find how much ore a miner can mine with an bronze pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 kgs/day
Then multiply that amount by 140% to find how much a miner can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 kgs/day * 140% = <<10*140*.01=14>>14 kgs/day
Then multiply the amount one miner can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of miners: 14 kgs/day/miner * 20 miners = <<14*20=280>>280 kgs/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 280 kgs/day * 30 days = <<280*30=8400>>8400 kgs/day
#### 8400"," Miners with 1 kgs keep mining for 30 days.
They mine 35 + 17 = <<35+17=42>>42 kgs of ore.
Nearly 62 kgs are kept for miners with two kgs of pickaxes.
They mine 24 kgs with two kgs of pickaxes; 12 + 24 = 28 kgs with two kgs of pickaxes.
28 + 24 = 52 kgs of ore.

336,"Jessica buys 14 shares of a stock for €23 each. The stock price increases 95% the first year Jessica holds it, then decreases 5% in the second year. What is the final value of all Jessica's shares?","First find the initial total value of Jessica's purchase: 14 shares * €23/share = €<<14*23=322>>322
Then find the amount of the first price increase: €322 * 0.95 = €<<322*0.95=305.9>>305
Add that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: €322 + €305.9 = €<<322+305.9=627.9>>627
Then multiply that amount by 5% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: €627.9 * 5% = €<<627.9*5*.01=31.395>>31
Then subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: €627 - €31 = €<<627-31=596>>596

The final price of a share is ↑20, ↑10 + ↑5 = √20, √10 + √5 = √20 + 15 = √20.
So, the days = 80, because we need to multiply all the days times 80.
