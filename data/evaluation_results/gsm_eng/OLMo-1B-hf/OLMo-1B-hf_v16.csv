473,Oliver saw a 60-foot shark with 6 30-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 30 inches/remora * 6 remoras = <<30*6=180>>180 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 180 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<180/12=15>>15 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 15 foot / 60 feet * 100% = 25%

#### 25"," 99% of 1 foot is 50 inches. Also, 37 dollars is 1 dollar so 6/37 = 0/20 = ten miles.

One 60-foot shark is ten miles away from Oliver's one foot of shark.

728,"William has 40 light orange spools of thread, 120 dark orange spools of thread, 30 light yellow spools of thread, and 50 dark yellow spools of thread. What percent of her spools are orange?","First find the number of orange spools: 40 spools + 120 spools = <<40+120=160>>160 spools
Then find the total number of spools: 30 spools + 50 spools + 160 spools = <<30+50+160=240>>240 spools
Then divide the number of orange spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 160 spools / 240 spools * 100% = 66%
#### 66"," They are 40/120/30/50 percent.

The amount of coloring is 40 - *dark* (90/30) = *dark* 20%
The amount of coloring = *light* 15 / *dark* 30%= *light* 50%

%15/15=1/1=1/2= 20/20 = 1/2 = 16/16 = *dark* 50%

The final answer is thus 50 - 16/16 = **25/50** = *light* 25/50% of her spools.

If he makes 5 giant cubes, 10 medium cubes, and 24 small cubes, how many lbs of water does he have left?","The giant cubes used up 40 lbs of water because 5 times 8 equals <<5*8=40>>40.
The medium cubes used up 70 lbs of water because 10 times 7 equals <<10*7=70>>70.
The small cubes used up 4 lbs of water because 24 times 1/6 equals 4.
This means that Eric has used up 114 lbs of water because 40 plus 70 plus 4 equals 114.
