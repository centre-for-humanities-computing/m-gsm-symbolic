473,Chris saw a 40-foot dolphin with 2 24-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 24 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<24*2=48>>48 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 48 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<48/12=4>>4 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 4 foot / 40 feet * 100% = 10%

There are 118 students and 23 are basketball players so that leaves 118-23 = <<118-23=95>>95 students

The total number of kiwis and cannolis that Oliver had before is 156 kiwis + 52 cannolis = <<156+52=208>>208 items
When he bought 47 fewer kiwis than cannolis, he bought 78 kiwis - 47 kiwis = <<78-47=31>>31 kiwis
In total, he bought 31 kiwis + 78 cannolis = <<31+78=109>>109 items

Therefore, they made 7170 - 4470 = <<7170-4470=2700>>2700 blueberry biscuits.
#### 2700"," Since they only have 1545 vanilla biscuits, we can't do the math because that would be too complicated when we're only dealing with vanilla.

If each serving of popcorn has 275 calories and I only have 275 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 275/275 of a serving = 1 of a serving

If a kilogram of trout costs £0.5, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?","Joshua will earn 41*£0.5 = £<<41*0.5=20.5>>20.5 from the first trout.
He will earn 42*£0.5 = £<<42*0.5=21>>21 for the second trout.
The rest of the trouts are 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5. He will earn 23*£0.5 = £<<23*0.5=11.5>>11.5 per each of them. So he will earn 5 * 11.5 = <<5*11.5>>=57.5
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is £20.5 + £21 + £57.5= £<<20.5+21+57.5=98>>99.
