661,Carl goes to the store to buy some sugar. The normal brand of sugar he buys costs $7 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 10% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses 1 kg of sugar per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for $5. How much did everything cost?,"The sugar he bought was 7*0.1=$<<7*0.1=0>>0 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys
So it cost 7+0=$<<7+0=7>>7 per kg
He goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kgs of sugar a week
So he paid 7.7*7=$<<7.7*7=53>>53 on sugar
That means his total bill was 53+5=$<<53+5=58>>58

459,"A farmer is buying feed for his sheep. He buys a variety of wheats, apples, cucumbers and corns. Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 8-pound bags. Wheats are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys thirty-six 60-pound packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the wheats, so he buys eighteen 60-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1650 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 4*3 = <<4*3=12>>12 pounds of corns.
He is buying 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 pounds of cucumbers.
He is buying 18*60 = <<18*60=1080>>1080 pounds of apples.
He is buying 36*60 = <<36*60=2160>>2160 pounds of wheats.
The weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 1080 + 2160 = <<12+48+1080+2160=3300>>3300 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 3300 / 1650 = <<3300/1650=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.

364,"There are 105 first-graders at Pine Valley School. 56 of them are girls. On Friday, 7 first-grade girls and 4 first-grade boys were absent. How many first grade boys were at Pine Valley School on Friday?","Of the 105 first graders, 56 are girls, so 105 students - 56 girls = <<105-56=49>>49 boys.
On Friday there were 49 boys - 4 absent = <<49-4=45>>45 boys.
#### 45"," Let x be the number of girls that were absent on Friday. We know that x = 105 - 7 girls = 55.
Now divide each side by two and leave the equation in the form of 9x/2
In the middle of the equation, we put x in its original form so it becomes 9x. This means both sides are multiplied by 2, leaving x=1.#### 1",0.36083230597432703,False
11,"Ava went to the cafe and bought various types of desserts. She bought 3 dozen donuts which cost $17 per dozen, 5 dozen tarts which cost $77 per dozen, and 3 dozen mini cheesecakes for $116 per dozen. How much was the total cost?","The total charge for the donuts was 3*$17 = $<<3*17=51>>51.
The total charge for the tarts was 5*$77 = $<<5*77=385>>385.
The total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 3*$116 = $<<3*116=348>>348.
Therefore the total amount Ava paid for the desserts was $51 + $385 + $348 = $<<51+385+348=784>>784.
#### 784"," The cost of each of the blue shirts is 12. You need to make sure the total count of blue shirts has a total of 120. Sum of the kids' total money is eventually 6
