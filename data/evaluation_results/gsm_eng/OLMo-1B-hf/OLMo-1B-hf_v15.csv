She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have £3 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts thrice. A round of mini-golf is £6. The go-karts cost £7 a ride. How many friends can she invite?","The go-karts will cost £21 per person because 7*3 = <<7*3=21>>21
Each person costs £30 because 3 + 6 + 21 = <<3+6+21=30>>30
8 total people can attend because 240 / 30 = <<240/30=8>>8
She can invite 7 friends because 8 - 1 =<<8-1=7>>7
#### 7"," Sophia's mum knew that £240 * 3 = <<240*3=600>>600, so the money she'd be spending on the party not counting the parties she was having already would be £240 + £8, which is £999. So our assumption is she wanted to spend a total of £999 - £999*2 = <<1000*2=200>>200, so that's *2*£999, which is *1*£1#### 1",0.48742880404461175,False
1099,"The biggest waterslide at Splash World is 360 yards long, and people slide down at 55 yards/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 240 yards long, but steeper, so people slide down at 90 yards/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?","First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 360 yards / 55 yards/minute = <<360/55=6>>6 minutes
Then find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 240 yards / 90 yards/minute = <<240/90=2>>2 minutes
Then subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 6 minutes - 2 minutes = <<6-2=4>>4 minutes
#### 4"," The slope of the two slides is the same. The ride takes longer because people are only able to slide down at velocities of 55 to 90 yards/minute. The slide size and velocity determine the ride length, not the slope. Therefore, 60 and 80 yards for the biggest waterslide and the smaller one.

Noah spends 13*£5 = £<<13*5=65>>65 on coloring books.
Noah spends 5 packs of trading cards * £1 = £<<5*1=5>>5 on trading cards.
Total Noah has spent £65 + £5 = £<<65+5=70>>70.

1084,"If Isabella and David have 800 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with David getting 80 feet more than Isabella, how much is left over for Isabella?","Let x be the amount of fence Isabella gets and y be the amount David gets. We know that y = x + 80, and y + x = 800.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+80=800
Subtracting the 80 from both sides, we get 2x=720
We divide each side by two, leaving x=360. This means Isabella has 360 feet of fence left over.
#### 360"," If they agree to share 800 feet, then Isabella gets 80 feet and David gets 200 feet. That means David has 800 + 200 = 1983 feet, and Isabella has a total of 1923 feet, giving her 250 feet to keep, 16 feet more than David. But she only wants 12 feet, and the minimum of 2000 ft belongs to David. So,

184,Ethan is rolling a d6 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"There are 4 numbers greater than 2 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 4/6=66%.
The chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 66% - 25% = 41%.
#### 41"," Dealing with a -1 vs -2 would be that there would be a replacement value for -3 on the die roll. This would be 3, and therefore Ethan would roll a number greater than 2 (2*3=6)

Now figure out how much grain total the horses need: 13 kg/horse * 30 horses = <<13*30=390>>390 kg

976,"Bob is selling muffins and strawberry pie for a fundraiser. On Monday, he sold 28 boxes of muffins and 16 fewer boxes of strawberry pie, than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Monday and 18 boxes of strawberry pie. If the muffins cost €13 and the strawberry pie cost €29, how much did Bob earn for two days?","He sold 28 + 11 = <<28+11=39>>39 boxes of muffins on Tuesday.
The total number of boxes of muffins that Bob sold is 28 + 39 = <<28+39=67>>67.
Bob earned 67*€13 = €<<67*13=871>>871 for selling muffins.
He sold 18 - 16 = <<18-16=2>>2 boxes of strawberry pie on Monday.
The total number of boxes of strawberry pie that Bob sold is 18 + 2 = <<18+2=20>>20.
He earned 20*€29 = €<<20*29=580>>580 for selling strawberry pie.
So, Bob earned €871 + €580 = €<<871+580=1451>>1451 for two days.
#### 1451"," Ensure that we know how many boxes of muffins or strawberry pie each earned. If there were from 50 to 150 pies in each fundraising establishment, this is going to be a lot simpler. So, even though there were 154 muffins, it would round down to 50. (Imagine if you sold a lot more - say 300 - oh no)

#### 75"," There were 50 caterpillars in that field, which means who are bees and grasshopper? ? Go with what? Does it mean you count the sun? Does it count? Does it count 0,1 or 2??? Maybe 2? Maybe 3???

2 so 1+1 is 2???? How many hours???????
Yes, answer is 2 hours from your memory!!
Day? Night???

#### 120"," On Monday, Noah would have exactly 4 hours for this exercise routine. 10 hours on Monday + 13.5 hours on Saturday would add up to 17 minutes.
He would exercise at least 17.5 hours on Monday because he would have three days of exercise.

On Saturday, he exercised at least 13.5 hours due to that day’####

In the third 26 seconds, 3*80=<<3*80=240>>240 kernels pop.
In the final 26 seconds, 240 / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 kernels pop.
Thus, Ella has 80 + 160 + 240 + 120 + 30 = <<80+160+240+120+30=630>>630 pieces of popcorn to eat.
#### 630","As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 80 pop in the first 26 seconds of cooking, then two times that amount in the next 26 seconds. The kernels increase to three times the initial popping rate in the next 26 seconds, but in the final 26 seconds, the popping slows down####

473,Joshua saw a 160-foot dolphin with 4 24-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 24 inches/remora * 4 remoras = <<24*4=96>>96 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 96 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<96/12=8>>8 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 8 foot / 160 feet * 100% = 5%

#### 5"," Because the remoras are completely part of the body of the dolphin, each part of the original dolphin's body is counted. The 4 remoras together divide a 160-foot body of the dolphin into 4 remoras of 57.6 feet.
