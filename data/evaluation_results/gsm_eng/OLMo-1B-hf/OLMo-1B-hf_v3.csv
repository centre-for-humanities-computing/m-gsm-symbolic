Therefore, Alex needs 880 - 306 = $<<880-306=574>>574 more for the science fair.
#### 574"," Alex's original donation of $130 was multiplied by 0.75 to find the amount he had to raise. Then this amount was subtracted from the science fair's costs of $880 to find $880 remaining after the science fair's costs are covered. $880 - $880 = $30 >>30>30
Therefore the amount Alex had to raise is $$####

If the force to move the SUV is 3% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the SUV?","His three children weigh 75*3=<<75*3=225>>225 pounds
So the total weight of the SUV and everything is 1300+100+225=<<1300+100+225=1625>>1625 pounds

After accounting for 1000 seats for graduates and 250 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 1000 + 250 = <<1000+250=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates
Minus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 7800 - 1250 = <<7800-1250=6550>>6550 remaining seats.
Divide remaining seats by the number of graduates. 6550/1000 = <<6550/1000=6>>6 tickets
#### 6"," Since they have over 8000 chairs, each ticket is divided into 64. Since the students leave 2 of each type of seat empty, their seats total 8880. Each faculty member will get 3914 tickets.Therefore total outgoing food and alcohol budget is: $7512.87.

1088,There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Ethan has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 55 minutes long. He goes to class for 5 days a week. He then spends 1/10 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day

Then multiply the amount one gnome can mine in a day with a titanium pickaxe by the number of gnomes: 13 pounds/day/gnome * 22 gnomes = <<13*22=297>>297 pounds/day

If he works five days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 days.

Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 744 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<744/12=62>>62 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the whale's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 62 foot / 310 feet * 100% = 20%

#### 20"," Based on this ratio, the remoras make up 10% of the whale's body length. Therefore, the combined length between the remoras and the whale is 40% of the whale's body length.
