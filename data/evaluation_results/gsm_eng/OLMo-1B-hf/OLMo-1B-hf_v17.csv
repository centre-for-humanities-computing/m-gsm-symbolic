If there were 1200 unoccupied beds in the clinic before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1200 beds - 420 beds = <<1200-420=780>>780 unoccupied beds.

1084,"If Maya and Noah have 800 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Noah getting 40 yards more than Maya, how much is left over for Maya?","Let x be the amount of fence Maya gets and y be the amount Noah gets. We know that y = x + 40, and y + x = 800.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+40=800
Subtracting the 40 from both sides, we get 2x=760
We divide each side by two, leaving x=380. This means Maya has 380 yards of fence left over.

If Jessica is sure to get 45% of the geography questions, then this means she is sure of her 6 questions*45/100 = <<6*45/100=2>>2 points.
From the geometry and physics questions, she is sure to get three quarters of it correctly so that is 24 questions*3/4 = <<24*3/4=18>>18 points.
Thus, she is sure of getting 2 points + 18 points = <<2+18=20>>20 points in her quiz.
#### 20","45% = <<45%=5>>5 points

266,"Dr. Jones sold his villa for $830,000. He paid the registration fees that amount to 1% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 4% of the selling price. If he also paid $670,000 for the remaining loan amount of the villa, how much is Dr. Jones's net proceeds from selling the villa?","Dr. Jones paid $830,000*1/100 = $8300 for the registration fees.
