How much did everything cost?,"The rice he bought was 13*0.35=€<<13*0.35=4>>4 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys
So it cost 13+4=€<<13+4=17>>17 per kg
He goes through 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 kgs of rice a week
So he paid 17.55*21=€<<17.55*21=368>>368 on rice
That means his total bill was 368+2=€<<368+2=370>>370
#### 370"," He bought a week's worth of rice for €25, which cost €15 in total, so the unit cost was €3.33/kg, or €3.33*25=50.66¢. The cost for the bagel is €2.50, or €2.50*25=28.33¢. Thus,
At a unit cost of €3.33/kg, the bagel cost 266% more than the rice, or €266/kg.

He only wants enough carrots to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys eight 8-pound bags. Oats are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys forty-two 65-pound packs.

Comet Hale-Bopp can be seen every 60 years, so Chris saw the comet for the first time when he was 78 years - 60 years = <<78-60=18>>18 years old.

1275,"Joshua's van breaks down. The van weighs 1700 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 425 pounds. He also has his four young children who weigh 85 pounds each in it. If the force to move the van is 1% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the van?","His four children weigh 85*4=<<85*4=340>>340 pounds
So the total weight of the van and everything is 1700+425+340=<<1700+425+340=2465>>2465 pounds
So he needs to generate 2465*0.01=<<2465*0.01=24>>24 pounds
#### 24"," He pushes it to the edge of a semi-circle. 11 * 1% = 11/100 = 0.111111 1/100=<<0.111111-2=0.999>>999 pounds
11 lbs / (44 Pounds x 12 participants) = 913.4 Pounds
So, 500 * 913.4 = <<500-11.44=10.545>>10.545 pounds.
