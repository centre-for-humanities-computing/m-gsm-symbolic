1088,There are 5 periods in the day for a normal student but Joe has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/4 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 classes a day
That means he spends 35*8=<<35*8=280>>280 minutes per day in class
So he spends 280*6=<<280*6=1680>>1680 minutes a week
That means he spends 1680*1/4=<<1680*1/4=420>>420 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.
So he spends 1680+420+420=<<1680+420+420=2520>>2520 minutes per week
So he spends 2520/60=<<2520/60=42>>42 hours per week
#### 42"," Joe goes to the school for 2100 minutes + 400 = ->>>>2800+400= -----20BBBB
He spends 5959 minutes on Saturday + 5858 = 6105 + 80=------15BBBB+573BBBB
He then spends 6553 minutes on Sunday + 6593 = -----16BBBB + 6047BBBB
Thus, Joe spends 8359+16= -----19BBBB by the end of week 1 for both.

If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking?","If Isabella can skip at one quarter the speed she can run, then she can run at 2*4=<<2*4=8>>8 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is thrice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 8/3=2.6666666666666665 miles per hour.
If half of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*1/2=<<6*1/2=3>>3 hours.
If half of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 hours.
Thus, she runs for 3 hours at 8 miles per hour, or 3*8=<<3*8=24>>24 miles.
She walks for 3 hours at 2.6666666666666665 miles per hour, or 3*2.6666666666666665=<<3*2.6666666666666665=8>>8 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 24+8=<<24+8=32>>32 miles.
#### 32"," Running at 2mph means she can travel twice as fast as walking. So a half hour equals approximately two miles.

Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the clinic after 4 weeks.","If 1/10 of the total capacity of the clinic beds is occupied, it means 1/10 * 1100 = <<1100*1/10=110>>110 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the clinic without new admissions is 1100 beds - 110 beds = <<1100-110=990>>990 beds.
If 25 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the clinic after one week is 25 patients/day * 7 days/week = 175 patients.
After 4 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the clinic is 175 patients/week * 4 weeks = <<175*4=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.

473,Ethan saw a 20-foot dolphin with 8 3-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 3 inches/remora * 8 remoras = <<3*8=24>>24 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 24 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<24/12=2>>2 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 2 foot / 20 feet * 100% = 10%

#### 10"," As a dolphin needs ~20 inches, neither remoras need to be higher than 8 inches. The percentage of the dolphin is 3 * 11 * 20/(20+0.25)=14%
