265,"Mrs. Lee is looking for a condo that will not go beyond her $360,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $320,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 4% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 11% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the condo than Mrs. Lee's budget?","The brokerage fee is $320,000*4/100 = $<<320,000*4/100=12,800>>12,800.
The transfer fee is $320,000*11/100 = $<<320,000*11/100=35,200>>35,200.
The total price of the condo is $320,000 + $12,800 + $35,200 = $368,000.
So, it is $368,000 - $360,000 = $<<368,000-360,000=8000>>8000 more than Mrs. Lee's budget.

On the sidewalk, Emily walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-ft walk, in minutes?","On the beach, Emily walks at a rate of 8 fts per 56 minutes, or 8/56 = 1/7 fts per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/7 = 0.2857142857142857 fts per minute.
To walk 12 ft(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 12/0.2857142857142857 = <<12/0.2857142857142857=42>>42 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Emily 56+42 = <<56+42=98>>98 minutes to walk her favorite route.

652,Henry hires a luxury car from 3 PM to 10 PM. He gets 2 hour(s) free. The first paid hour is €49 and each hour after that is four times the cost. How much did he pay?,"He got it for 10-3=<<10-3=7>>7 hours
He pays for 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 hours
The first hour cost 1*49=€<<1*49=49>>49
The other 5-1=4 hours are more expensive
They cost 49*4=€<<49*4=196>>196 per hour
So those 4 hours cost 4*196=€<<4*196=784>>784
So he pays 784+49=€<<784+49=833>>833 in total
#### 833"," Henry paid 24*€49= <<24+49=54>>54 for the payed hour three hours + €49/hours = ($1=4.5>>1.5=4.5$). + 24.5*4.5 = $48.75.
Hence, he paid €24.75 + €0.25 = €<23.2>.
The next paid hour is two hours at £1.7 per hour. Therefore, he paid £<23.2>.

661,David goes to the store to buy some flour. The normal brand of flour he buys costs $20 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 10% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 3 kilogram of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for $4. How much did everything cost?,"The flour he bought was 20*0.1=$<<20*0.1=2>>2 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys
So it cost 20+2=$<<20+2=22>>22 per kilogram
He goes through 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 kilograms of flour a week
So he paid 22*21=$<<22*21=462>>462 on flour
That means his total bill was 462+4=$<<462+4=466>>466
#### 466"," David bought a week's worth of flour because it was about 3 times more expensive.
Therefore, they don't get three times as much as some-how spending 3 times as much.

459,"A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of corns, wheats, carrots and apples. Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys six 3-oz boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 8-oz bags. Corns are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys forty 65-oz packs. Wheats are a staple to supplement the corns, so he buys nineteen 50-oz sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1800 ozs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 ozs of apples.
He is buying 4*8 = <<4*8=32>>32 ozs of carrots.

He is buying 40*65 = <<40*65=2600>>2600 ozs of corns.

1084,"If Ethan and Kenneth have 340 meters of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Kenneth getting 20 meters more than Ethan, how much is left over for Ethan?","Let x be the amount of fence Ethan gets and y be the amount Kenneth gets. We know that y = x + 20, and y + x = 340.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+20=340
Subtracting the 20 from both sides, we get 2x=320
We divide each side by two, leaving x=160. This means Ethan has 160 meters of fence left over.
#### 160"," Question answer

*220 / 340 = 1 \* 12.25 = 4.75
*4.75 / 4.75 = 1.25 = **0.75**

Or in simple math,

*120 / 240 = 1 \* 5 = **4.75** for 100 meters

Total --> 240 / 340 = 1.48

Perhaps it is easier to solve it by using the cheat --

*120 / 240 = 0.48, then 240 / 400 = 0.48, and so on... until you get####
