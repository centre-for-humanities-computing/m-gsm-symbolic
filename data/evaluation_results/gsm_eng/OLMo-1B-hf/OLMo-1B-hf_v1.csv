473,Jessica saw a 300-foot shark with 9 4-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 4 inches/remora * 9 remoras = <<4*9=36>>36 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 36 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<36/12=3>>3 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 3 foot / 300 feet * 100% = 1%

#### 1"," The shark has 8 remoras.
The shark is 300 - 8 = <<600/8=210>>210 feet in length.
The combined length of the remoras are 9 + 210 = <<210+18=325>>325 feet in length.
Therefore, the combined length of the remoras are 61 - 18 = 49 feet.
Thus, the eminent shark's combined length is 49 - 18 = 32 feet.

So, Dr. Garcia paid a total of $12,800 + $32,000 + $450,000 = $494,800 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.

The broker-agency fee is 5% of $26,296,000. Furthermore, the paid transfer fees are 2% of $26,296,000.
The net proceeds from selling the cottage is $640,000 - $26,296,000 = $53,296,000. Hence, Dr. Garcia's total proceeds from selling the cottage is $53,296,000 - $450,k####
