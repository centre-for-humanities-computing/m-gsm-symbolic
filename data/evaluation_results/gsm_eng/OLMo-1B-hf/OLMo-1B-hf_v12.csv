After four liters of peach drink was spilled, there were 9-4 = <<9-4=5>>5 liters of peach drink left.
Out of the 5 liters, 5*1/5 = <<5*1/5=1>>1 liters are water.

If she can skip at 4 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in ten hours if she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking?","If Laura can skip at two thirds the speed she can run, then she can run at 4*3/2=<<4*3/2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is thrice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/3=2 miles per hour.
If half of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 10*1/2=<<10*1/2=5>>5 hours.
If half of the time is spent running, then she runs for 10-5=<<10-5=5>>5 hours.

1264,"Amanda is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 60 pop in the first 26 seconds of cooking, then two times that amount in the next 26 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next 26 seconds, but in the final 26 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 26 seconds. After Amanda takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 26 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Amanda have to eat?","In the second 26 seconds of cooking, 2*60=<<2*60=120>>120 kernels pop.
In the third 26 seconds, 4*60=<<4*60=240>>240 kernels pop.
In the final 26 seconds, 240 / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 kernels pop.
Thus, Amanda has 60 + 120 + 240 + 120 + 30 = <<60+120+240+120+30=570>>570 pieces of popcorn to eat.
#### 570"," Answer should be 6 popcorn balls.

In total there are 17 girls + 68 boys = <<17+68=85>>85 kids in the playground
