And these 46 minutes cost 46 * 0.5 = £<<46*0.5=23>>23.
So in total, the 87-minute call would cost 30 + 23 = £53.
#### 53"," Easier than expected: for 87 minutes, the price drops 14x ($0.25*87x=$0.65/$0.75)=$(0.5*87*107x=$0.75/£0.75)*87=1665x1101x800

1031,"Greenville High School is holding graduation in their Gymnasium this year which has space for 6100 people. After accounting for 450 seats for graduates and 400 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 450 + 400 = <<450+400=850>>850 seats for faculty and graduates
Minus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6100 - 850 = <<6100-850=5250>>5250 remaining seats.
Divide remaining seats by the number of graduates. 5250/450 = <<5250/450=11>>11 tickets
#### 11"," So each graduate will have 4500 tickets to give to their friends and family.
Rotat: Each graduate will receive 4500 tickets mate.
Hop: The graduates will each receive 4500 paired tickets.

The second biggest waterslide is 210 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 70 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?","First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 350 meters / 60 meters/minute = <<350/60=5>>5 minutes
Then find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 210 meters / 70 meters/minute = <<210/70=3>>3 minutes
Then subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = <<5-3=2>>2 minutes
#### 2"," On the largest slide, a person slides down all the way (i.e. ""head first / upright"") 
Then slowly, the slide becomes more vertical (i.e. all the muscles in the body are turned inwards, so the person slides into the water harder)

Jason has $62.814715025906736 - $3.12 = $59 left.
#### 59"," Jason has $62.814715025906736 + 24 nails = 11152.6866113126245
