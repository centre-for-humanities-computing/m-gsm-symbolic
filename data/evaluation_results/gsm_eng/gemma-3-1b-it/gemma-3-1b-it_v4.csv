If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends one quarter of the time running and three quarters of the time walking?","If Sophia can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 12/2=6 miles per hour.
