788,"Alex is raising money for a science fair. He has applied for help from the community center, which has decided to cover one fifth of the cost of the science fair. How much money is Alex missing if he has $130 and the science fair costs $880?","Alex's community center has decided to pay 880*1/5=$<<880*1/5=176>>176 for his science fair.
In total Alex has covered 176 + 130 = $<<176+130=306>>306 for his science fair
Therefore, Alex needs 880 - 306 = $<<880-306=574>>574 more for the science fair.
#### 574"," The community center covers one fifth of the cost, so they cover $880 / 5 = $176.
Alex is missing $130 - $176 = -46. This is not possible.

Let's re-read the problem to clarify: Alex has $130 and the science fair costs $880. The community center covers one fifth of the cost, which is $880/5 = $176.####

How much water is in the remaining 34 liters?","There are 30*1/3 = <<30*1/3=10>>10 liters of water from the 30 liters peach drink.
After five liters of lemon drink was spilled, there were 9-5 = <<9-5=4>>4 liters of lemon drink left.
Out of the 4 liters, 4*1/4 = <<4*1/4=1>>1 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 liters of water out of the 34 liters.
#### 11","
First calculate the amount of water in the 9 liters of lemon drink. Since it's one quarter water, each liter is 1/4 water. So 9 liters * (1/4) = 2.25 liters of water.
Then calculate the amount of water in the 30 liters of peach drink. Since it's one third water, each liter is 1/3 water. So 30 Litrs####

Then find how many batches of carrots she needs to cook: 140 carrots / 20 carrots/batch = <<140/20=7>>7 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 7 batches * 20 minutes/batch = <<7*20=140>>140 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 140 minutes + 20 minutes = <<140+20=160>>160 minutes
#### 160"," Emily peels 7 carrots per minute, and sautés 20 carrots per 20 minutes.
So, one carrot is sautéed in 20 minutes / 20 carrots = 1 minute.
That means she sautés 140 carrots in 140 carrots / 1 minute = 140 minutes.
