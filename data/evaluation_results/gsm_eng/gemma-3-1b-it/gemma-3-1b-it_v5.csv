If a kilogram of tune costs $1.0, how much will he earn after selling all the tunes to the market?","Henry will earn 64*$1 = $<<64*1=64>>64 from the first tune.
He will earn 41*$1 = $<<41*1=41>>41 for the second tune.
The rest of the tunes are 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5. He will earn 20*$1 = $<<20*1=20>>20 per each of them. So he will earn 5 * 20 = <<5*20>>=100
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunes is $64 + $41 + $100= $<<64+41+100=205>>205.
#### 205"," The total weight of the tunes Henry caught is 64 + 41 + 20 = 125 kilograms.
Since a kilogram of tune costs $1.0, the total cost of the tunes is 125 * $1.0 = $125.
Henry will earn $125 - 64 - 41 - 20 = $125 - 125 = $0.
