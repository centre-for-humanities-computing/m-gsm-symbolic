He only wants enough carrots to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 12-lb bags. Hay are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys forty-two 75-lb packs. Corns are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys sixteen 60-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2100 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","The farmer is buying 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 lbs of wheats.
He is buying 6*12 = <<6*12=72>>72 lbs of carrots.
He is buying 16*60 = <<16*60=960>>960 lbs of corns.
He is buying 42*75 = <<42*75=3150>>3150 lbs of hay.
The weight of all the feed is 18 + 72 + 960 + 3150 = <<18+72+960+3150=4200>>4200 lbs.
Thus, the farmer needs 4200 / 2100 = <<4200/2100=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.
#### 2","
Hay: 42 packs * 75 lbs/pack = 3150 lbs
Carrots: 16 sacks * 12 lbs/sack = 192 lbs
Wheats: 6 boxes * 3 lbs/box = 18 lbs
Total feed = 3150 + 192 + 18 = 3360 lbs
The truck can carry 2100 lbs / 2100 lbs/trip = 1 trip
The farmer needs 2 trips because the 3360 lbs > 2100 lbs.
