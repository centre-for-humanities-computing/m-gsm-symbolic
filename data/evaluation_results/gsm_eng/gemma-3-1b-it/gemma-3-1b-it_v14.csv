1088,There are 5 periods in the day for a normal student but Joe has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/4 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?,"He takes 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 classes a day
That means he spends 35*8=<<35*8=280>>280 minutes per day in class

Total minutes in a week = 5 periods * 60 minutes/period = 300 minutes.
Joe takes 3 extra classes, so he has 3 classes * 35 minutes/class = 105 minutes in extra classes.
The remaining minutes are 300 - 105 = 195 minutes.

Then multiply that amount by 135% to find how much a gnome can mine with a diamond pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 135% = <<10*135*.01=13>>13 pounds/day
Then multiply the amount one gnome can mine in a day with a diamond pickaxe by the number of gnomes: 13 pounds/day/gnome * 23 gnomes = <<13*23=310>>310 pounds/day

The total number of beds in the clinic without new admissions is 1100 beds - 110 beds = <<1100-110=990>>990 beds.
If 25 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the clinic after one week is 25 patients/day * 7 days/week = 175 patients.
After 4 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the clinic is 175 patients/week * 4 weeks = <<175*4=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 990 unoccupied beds in the clinic before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 990 beds - 700 beds = <<990-700=290>>290 unoccupied beds.

Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 24 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<24/12=2>>2 foot.
