Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<720/12=60>>60 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 60 foot / 120 feet * 100% = 50%

989,Isabella can peel 4 mushrooms a minute and saute 20 mushrooms in 13 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 120 mushrooms?,"First find how long it takes Isabella to peel the mushrooms: 120 mushrooms / 4 mushrooms/minute = <<120/4=30>>30 minutes
Then find how many batches of mushrooms she needs to cook: 120 mushrooms / 20 mushrooms/batch = <<120/20=6>>6 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 6 batches * 13 minutes/batch = <<6*13=78>>78 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Isabella spends: 78 minutes + 30 minutes = <<78+30=108>>108 minutes
#### 108"," Isabella can peel 4 mushrooms/minute * 13 minutes = 52 mushrooms.
She can saute 20 mushrooms / 13 minutes = 15.38 mushrooms/minute.
So it will take her 52 + 15.38 = 67.38 minutes to peel and saute 120 mushrooms.
We can round to 67 minutes.
