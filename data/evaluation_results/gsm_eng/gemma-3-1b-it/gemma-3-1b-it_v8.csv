The kernels increase to five times the initial popping rate in the next 22 seconds, but in the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 22 seconds.

How many pounds of ore can 23 trolls with bronze pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?,"First find how much ore a troll can mine with an bronze pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day
Then multiply that amount by 130% to find how much a troll can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 130% = <<10*130*.01=13>>13 pounds/day
Then multiply the amount one troll can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of trolls: 13 pounds/day/troll * 23 trolls = <<13*23=299>>299 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 299 pounds/day * 28 days = <<299*28=8372>>8372 pounds/day

Let $x$ be the amount of ore mined per day with a bare hand.
With a bronze pickaxe, the troll mines $2x$ pounds of ore per day.
With a bronze pickaxe, the troll mines 1.5 times as much as with a bare hand, so $2x = 1.5x$, which means $0.5x = 0$, and thus $x=0$.

How old was Lucas when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"Lucas saw the Comet for the second time when he was 42 years * 2= <<42*2=84>>84 years old.
Comet Halley can be seen every 65 years, so Lucas saw the comet for the first time when he was 84 years - 65 years = <<84-65=19>>19 years old.

When Lucas was 2 * 42 = 84 years old, the comet was 65 years old.
Since the comet is 65 years old, then Lucas was 84 - 65 = 19 years old.

1084,"If Isabella and Andrea have 240 meters of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Andrea getting 190 meters more than Isabella, how much is left over for Isabella?","Let x be the amount of fence Isabella gets and y be the amount Andrea gets. We know that y = x + 190, and y + x = 240.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+190=240
Subtracting the 190 from both sides, we get 2x=50
We divide each side by two, leaving x=25. This means Isabella has 25 meters of fence left over.
#### 25"," Let Isabella's fence be 'x' and Andrea's fence be 'y'. We have:
x + y = 240
y = x + 190
Substitute the second equation into the first:
x + (x + 190) = 240
2x + 190 = 240
2x = 240 - 190
2x = 50
x = 25
So Isabella's fence is 25 meters. Andrea's fence is 25 + 190 = 215 meters.
