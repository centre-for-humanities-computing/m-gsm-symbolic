He dropped one quarter of the buttons, so he lost (1/4) * 76 = 19 buttons.
He found 15 buttons, so he lost 76 - 15 = 61 buttons.
He then found 7 buttons, so he is left with 61 - 7 = 54 buttons.

Jersey: €15
Sweatpants: €15 + €4 = €19
Athletic shoes: €19 - €40 = -21
The problem states that the athletic shoes were originally €40 but were on sale for one fifth price.
This means that they cost €40/5 = €8
So the athletic shoes cost €40 - €8 = €32.

The transfer fee is $310,000*11/100 = $<<310,000*11/100=34,100>>34,100.
The total price of the townhouse is $310,000 + $15,500 + $34,100 = $359,600.
So, it is $359,600 - $320,000 = $<<359,600-320,000=39,600>>39,600 more than Dr. Patel's budget.

Next, calculate the total price of the townhouse, including brokerage and transfer fees: $310,000 + 11% of $310,000 = $310,000 + (0.11 * $310,000) = $310,000 + $####
