991,Comet Encke orbits the sun every 65 years. Michael's grandfather saw the Comet when he was 25 years old.

How old was Michael when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"Michael saw the Comet for the second time when he was 25 years * 3= <<25*3=75>>75 years old.
Comet Encke can be seen every 65 years, so Michael saw the comet for the first time when he was 75 years - 65 years = <<75-65=10>>10 years old.
#### 10"," When Michael was 25, his grandfather was 25 * 65 = 1625.
When Michael was 3 times the age of his grandfather, he was 3 * 1625 = 4875.
The time between these ages is 4875 - 25 = 4850 years.
Comet Encke orbits every 65 years, so the comet passed by Michael when he was 4850/65 = 75 years old.
