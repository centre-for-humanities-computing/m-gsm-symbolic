If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in eight hours if she spends one quarter of the time running and three quarters of the time walking?","If Anna can skip at three fifths the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*5/3=<<3*5/3=5>>5 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is five times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 5/5=1 miles per hour.

If one quarter of the time is spent running, then she runs for 8-6=<<8-6=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 5 miles per hour, or 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 miles.
