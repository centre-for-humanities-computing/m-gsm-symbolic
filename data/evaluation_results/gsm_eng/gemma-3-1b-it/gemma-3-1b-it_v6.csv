Let's find the total cost of the balls.
Number of orange balls = 19
Cost of orange balls = 19 * €10 = €190
Number of blue balls = 17
Cost of blue balls = 17 * €6 = €102
Number of pink balls = 42
Cost of pink balls = 42 * €7 = €294
Total cost = €190 + €102 + €294 = €586
The store will receive €586.

When Eric was two times the age his uncle was, he was 42 * 2 = 84 years old.

Therefore, Oliver needs 900 - 790 = €<<900-790=110>>110 more for the school trip.

20,"I have 12 liters of peach drink that are three quarters water and I wish to add it to 28 liters of apple drink that is one quarter water. But as I pour it, I spill four liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 36 liters?","There are 28*1/4 = <<28*1/4=7>>7 liters of water from the 28 liters apple drink.
After four liters of peach drink was spilled, there were 12-4 = <<12-4=8>>8 liters of peach drink left.
Out of the 8 liters, 8*3/4 = <<8*3/4=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 7 + 6 = <<7+6=13>>13 liters of water out of the 36 liters.
#### 13","
We start with 12 liters of peach drink three quarters water. This is equivalent to (3/4) * 12 = 9 liters water.
Then we add 28 liters of apple drink that is one quarter water. This means 28 = (1/4) * 28, which is true.
We spill 4 liters of the peach drink.
So we have 9 - 4 = 5 liters of peach drink####

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+150=220
Subtracting the 150 from both sides, we get 2x=70
We divide each side by two, leaving x=35. This means Oliver has 35 feet of fence left over.
