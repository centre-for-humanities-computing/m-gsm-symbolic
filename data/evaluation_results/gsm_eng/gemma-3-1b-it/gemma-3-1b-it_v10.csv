661,Carl goes to the store to buy some sugar. The normal brand of sugar he buys costs $7 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 10% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses 1 kg of sugar per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for $5. How much did everything cost?,"The sugar he bought was 7*0.1=$<<7*0.1=0>>0 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys
So it cost 7+0=$<<7+0=7>>7 per kg
He goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kgs of sugar a week
So he paid 7.7*7=$<<7.7*7=53>>53 on sugar
That means his total bill was 53+5=$<<53+5=58>>58
#### 58","
Cost of sugar = 1 kg/day * 7 days = 7 kg cost.
Cost of muffin = $5.
Total cost = 7 kg + 5 = 12 kg.

Let the selling price be $S = 930,000$.
