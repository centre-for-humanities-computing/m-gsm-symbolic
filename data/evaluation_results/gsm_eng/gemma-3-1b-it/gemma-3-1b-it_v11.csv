473,Emma saw a 60-foot shark with 4 36-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 36 inches/remora * 4 remoras = <<36*4=144>>144 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 144 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<144/12=12>>12 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 12 foot / 60 feet * 100% = 20%

#### 20"," The combined length of the remoras is 4 * 36 = <<4*36=144>>144 inches.
The shark's body length is 60 feet, which is 60 * 12 = <<60*12=720>>720 inches.
The ratio of the remoras' length to the shark's length is 144 / 720 = <<144/720=0.2083>>0.2083.
Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 0.2####
