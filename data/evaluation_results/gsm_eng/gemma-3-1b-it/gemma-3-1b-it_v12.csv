#### 23"," Emily peels clams at a rate of 10 clams/minute and sautés clams at a rate of 45 clams in 7 minutes.
To peel 90 clams, we need to determine the number of minutes it takes to peel 90 clams.
We can write the proportion:
$\frac{10}{7} = \frac{90}{x}$
$10x = 7(90)$
$10x = 630$
$x = \frac{630}{10} = 63$
