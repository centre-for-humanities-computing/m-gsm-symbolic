So, Dr. Davis paid a total of $15,800 + $31,600 + $500,000 = $547,400 for the legal, realtor, and loan fees.
Hence, Dr. Davis's net proceeds is $790,000 - $547,400 = $242,600.

473,Henry saw a 70-foot shark with 7 12-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 12 inches/remora * 7 remoras = <<12*7=84>>84 inches.
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 84 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<84/12=7>>7 foot.
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 7 foot / 70 feet * 100% = 10%

#### 10","
The combined length of the remoras is 7 * 12 = 84 inches.
The shark's body length is 70 feet.
To convert feet to inches, we know that 1 foot = 12 inches.
So, the shark's body length in inches is 70 * 12 = 840 inches.
The percentage is (84 / 840) * 100 = <<84/840*100=12%>>12%
