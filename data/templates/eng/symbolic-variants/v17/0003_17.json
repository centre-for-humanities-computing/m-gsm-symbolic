{"question": "A class of 199 students has various hobbies. 61 like to read, 39 like to play cycling, and the rest like to either hike or play video games. How many like to hike if the number that like to play video games is twice the number that prefer playing cycling?", "answer": "The number of students that like to play video games is twice as many as the number who like cycling, so 2 * 39 = <<2*39=78>>78\nThe number that like to hike is 199 total students - 61 that like to read - 39 that like to play cycling - 78 that like to play video games = <<199-61-39-78=21>>21\n#### 21", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
