{"question": "Chris's SUV breaks down. The SUV weighs 1450 kilograms and he has luggage in it weighing 100 kilograms. He also has his two young friends who weigh 85 kilograms each in it. If the force to move the SUV is 4% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the SUV?", "answer": "His two friends weigh 85*2=<<85*2=170>>170 kilograms\nSo the total weight of the SUV and everything is 1450+100+170=<<1450+100+170=1720>>1720 kilograms\nSo he needs to generate 1720*0.04=<<1720*0.04=68>>68 kilograms\n#### 68", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
