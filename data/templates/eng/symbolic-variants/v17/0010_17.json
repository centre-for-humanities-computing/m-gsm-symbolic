{"question": "To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay £0.5 for each minute of your call. After 28 minutes, that price drops to £0.2 per minute. How much would a 67-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 28 minutes would be a cost of 28 * 0.5 = £<<28*0.5=14>>14.\nAfter that, there are 67 - 28 = <<67-28=39>>39 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 39 minutes cost 39 * 0.2 = £<<39*0.2=7>>7.\nSo in total, the 67-minute call would cost 14 + 7 = £21.\n#### 21", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
