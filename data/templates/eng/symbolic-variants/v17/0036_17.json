{"question": "Andrea went to the patisserie and bought various types of pastries. She bought 5 dozen danishes which cost $20 per dozen, 6 dozen tarts which cost $80 per dozen, and 9 dozen brownies for $113 per dozen. How much was the total cost?", "answer": "The total charge for the danishes was 5*$20 = $<<5*20=100>>100.\nThe total charge for the tarts was 6*$80 = $<<6*80=480>>480.\nThe total charge for the brownies was 9*$113 = $<<9*113=1017>>1017.\nTherefore the total amount Andrea paid for the pastries was $100 + $480 + $1017 = $<<100+480+1017=1597>>1597.\n#### 1597", "id_orig": 11, "id_shuffled": 36}
