{"question": "Madison is trying to decide whether to do her financial planning herself or hire one accountant. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 10 fewer hours of freelance work, losing £50/hour in missed income. The accountant charges £163. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Madison does her financial planning herself: £50/hour * 10 hours = £<<50*10=500>>500\nThen subtract the accountant's charge to find how much money Madison saves: £500 - £163 = £<<500-163=337>>337\n#### 337", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
