{"question": "Joshua caught 4 tunes last Friday, the first tune he caught weighs 55 kgs, the second tune he caught weighs 49 kgs, and the remaining tune he caught weighs 36 kgs. If a kg of tune costs €2.0, how much will he earn after selling all the tunes to the market?", "answer": "Joshua will earn 55*€2 = €<<55*2=110>>110 from the first tune.\nHe will earn 49*€2 = €<<49*2=98>>98 for the second tune.\nThe rest of the tunes are 4-2 = <<4-2=2>>2. He will earn 36*€2 = €<<36*2=72>>72 per each of them. So he will earn 2 * 72 = <<2*72>>=144\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunes is €110 + €98 + €144= €<<110+98+144=352>>352.\n#### 352", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
