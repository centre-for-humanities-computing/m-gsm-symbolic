{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Aqua Adventure is 380 meters long, and people slide down at 55 meters/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 280 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 70 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 380 meters / 55 meters/minute = <<380/55=6>>6 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 280 meters / 70 meters/minute = <<280/70=4>>4 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 6 minutes - 4 minutes = <<6-4=2>>2 minutes\n#### 2", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
