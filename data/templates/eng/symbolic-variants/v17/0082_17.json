{"question": "At the beginning of the gathering, there were 72 teachers and 64 engineers. After 45 minutes, 1/8 of the total number of people left. How many engineers are left if 24 teachers stayed at the gathering?", "answer": "There were a total of 72 teachers + 64 engineers = <<72+64=136>>136 people who attended the gathering.\nAfter 45 minutes, 136 people * 1/8 = <<136*1/8=17>>17 people left the gathering.\nThis means 136 people - 17 people = <<136-17=119>>119 people stayed.\nOut of the 119 who stayed, 119 people - 24 teachers = <<119-24=95>>95 were engineers.\n#### 95", "id_orig": 320, "id_shuffled": 82}
