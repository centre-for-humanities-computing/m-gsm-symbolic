{"question": "In a 30-item quiz, 20% of the questions are geography, and the rest are equally divided as geometry and physics questions. If Jessica is sure to get 45% of the geography questions, and three quarters of the geometry and physics questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?", "answer": "The geometry and physics questions comprises 100% - 20% = 80% of the quiz.\nThere are 30 questions*20/100 = <<30*20/100=6>>6 geography questions.\nThere are a total of 30 questions*80/100 = <<30*80/100=24>>24 geometry and physics questions.\nIf Jessica is sure to get 45% of the geography questions, then this means she is sure of her 6 questions*45/100 = <<6*45/100=2>>2 points.\nFrom the geometry and physics questions, she is sure to get three quarters of it correctly so that is 24 questions*3/4 = <<24*3/4=18>>18 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 2 points + 18 points = <<2+18=20>>20 points in her quiz.\n#### 20", "id_orig": 1021, "id_shuffled": 19}
