{"question": "The vending machines sell crackers for 35 cents and pretzels for 100 cents. Ethan spent $10 and got 6 bags of crackers and had 9% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?", "answer": "Ethan got $0.9 in change because $10*9/100 = <<10*9/100=0.9>>0.9\nEthan spent $9.1 because 10 - 0.9 = <<10-0.9=9.1>>9.1\nEthan spent $2.1 on crackers because 6*0.35 = <<6*0.35=2.1>>2.1\nEthan spent 7 on pretzels because 9.1 - 2.1 = <<9.1-2.1=7>>7\nEthan bought 7 pretzels because 7 / 1 = <<7=7>>7\n#### 7", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
