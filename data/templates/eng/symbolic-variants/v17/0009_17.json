{"question": "When Madison watches her brother, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 42 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 49 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 27 multicolored rings on it. Madison recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her brother up to 181. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Madison has 42 + 49 + 27 + T = 118 + T = 181 toys for her brother.\nThus, T = 181 - 118 = <<181-118=63>>63 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 63", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
