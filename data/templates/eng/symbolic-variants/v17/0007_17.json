{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys a variety of apples, hay, beets and wheats. Since wheats are a rare treat, he only buys six 2-ounce boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the cows while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 8-ounce bags. Apples are the main diet of his cows, so he buys forty-two 70-ounce packs. Hay are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys eighteen 50-ounce sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1950 ounces at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 ounces of wheats.\nHe is buying 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 ounces of beets.\nHe is buying 18*50 = <<18*50=900>>900 ounces of hay.\nHe is buying 42*70 = <<42*70=2940>>2940 ounces of apples.\nThe weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 900 + 2940 = <<12+48+900+2940=3900>>3900 ounces.\nThus, the farmer needs 3900 / 1950 = <<3900/1950=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
