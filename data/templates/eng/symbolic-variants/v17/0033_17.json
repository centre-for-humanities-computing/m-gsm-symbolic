{"question": "Maya and Abby are sisters from Houston who love collecting signatures from politicians. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 3 weeks, Maya and Abby compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Maya has 21 signatures in her book, and Abby has 59. The sisters have 3 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 140 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Maya and Abby have already collected 21 + 59 signatures = <<21+59=80>>80 signatures.\nSince their goal is 140, they need to collect 140 - 80 signatures. 140 - 80 = <<140-80=60>>60 signatures\n#### 60", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
