{"question": "If Maya and Noah have 800 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Noah getting 40 yards more than Maya, how much is left over for Maya?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Maya gets and y be the amount Noah gets. We know that y = x + 40, and y + x = 800.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+40=800\nSubtracting the 40 from both sides, we get 2x=760\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=380. This means Maya has 380 yards of fence left over.\n#### 380", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
