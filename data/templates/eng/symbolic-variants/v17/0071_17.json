{"question": "Ethan is feeding his livestock hay. Each duck needs 12 kg, and each turkey needs 4 kg less than twice the amount each duck needs. If there are 36 ducks and 27 turkeys, how many kg of hay does Ethan need?", "answer": "First figure out how much hay each turkey needs: 12 kg * 2 - 4 = <<12*2-4=20>>20 kg/turkey\nNow figure out how much hay total the turkeys need: 20 kg/turkey * 27 turkeys = <<20*27=540>>540 kg\nNow figure out how much hay total the ducks need: 12 kg/duck * 36 ducks = <<12*36=432>>432 kg\nNow add the two amounts of hay to find the total: 540 kg + 432 kg = <<540+432=972>>972 kg\n#### 972", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
