{"question": "Sarah qualified for a spot on the basketball team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a jersey for €15, a pair of basketball sweatpants for €4 more than the jersey cost, and a pair of athletic shoes that were originally €40 but were on sale for one fifth price. She had a coupon for €1 off the package of €12 athletic headbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The sweatpants were €4 more than the jersey, so they cost €4 + €15 = €<<4+15=19>>19.\nHer athletic shoes were one fifth the original €40 price, so they cost €40*1/5=€8.\nWith her coupon, the headbands were €12 - €1 = €<<12-1=11>>11.\nThe jersey, sweatpants, athletic shoes, and headbands together cost €15 + €19 + €8 + €11 = €<<15+19+8+11=53>>53.\n#### 53", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
