{"question": "One goblin can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a nickel pickaxe and 40% more with a titanium pickaxe than with a nickel pickaxe. How many kgs of ore can 20 goblins with titanium pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a goblin can mine with an nickel pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 kgs/day\nThen multiply that amount by 140% to find how much a goblin can mine with a titanium pickaxe: 10 kgs/day * 140% = <<10*140*.01=14>>14 kgs/day\nThen multiply the amount one goblin can mine in a day with a titanium pickaxe by the number of goblins: 14 kgs/day/goblin * 20 goblins = <<14*20=280>>280 kgs/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 280 kgs/day * 28 days = <<280*28=7840>>7840 kgs/day\n#### 7840", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
