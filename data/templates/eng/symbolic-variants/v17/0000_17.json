{"question": "Oliver saw a 330-foot shark with 9 44-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 44 inches/remora * 9 remoras = <<44*9=396>>396 inches.\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 396 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<396/12=33>>33 foot.\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 33 foot / 330 feet * 100% = 10%\n\n#### 10", "id_orig": 473, "id_shuffled": 0}
