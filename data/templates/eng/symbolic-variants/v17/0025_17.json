{"question": "In Mr. Smith's class of 98 students, 16% of the class are volleyball players. Out of the remaining class, 18% of the students are robotics club members or part of choir members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "16% of the 98 student class are volleyball players so that's 0.16*98 = <<0.16*98=15>>15 students\nThere are 98 students and 15 are volleyball players so that leaves 98-15 = <<98-15=83>>83 students\n18% of the remaining 83 students are part of choir members or robotics club members so that's 0.18*83 = <<0.18*83=14>>14 students\n15 students are volleyball players and 14 are part of choir members/robotics club members so 15+14 = <<15+14=30>>30 students will be leaving early\n#### 30", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
