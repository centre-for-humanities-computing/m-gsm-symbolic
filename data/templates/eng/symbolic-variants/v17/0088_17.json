{"question": "Claire can run four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is one third as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in eight hours if she spends three quarters of the time running and one quarter of the time walking?", "answer": "If Claire can skip at one third the speed she can run, then she can run at 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is four times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.\nIf one quarter of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 8*1/4=<<8*1/4=2>>2 hours.\nIf three quarters of the time is spent running, then she runs for 8-2=<<8-2=6>>6 hours.\nThus, she runs for 6 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36 miles.\nShe walks for 2 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 2*1.5=<<2*1.5=3>>3 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 36+3=<<36+3=39>>39 miles.\n#### 39", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
