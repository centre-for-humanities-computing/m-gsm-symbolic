{"question": "Eric wants to make different sized ice cubes with 80 ozs of water. He can make giant cubes that use 4 ozs per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ozs, and small cubes that use 1/8 oz. If he makes 3 giant cubes, 10 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many ozs of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 12 ozs of water because 3 times 4 equals <<3*4=12>>12.\nThe medium cubes used up 20 ozs of water because 10 times 2 equals <<10*2=20>>20.\nThe small cubes used up 1 ozs of water because 8 times 1/8 equals 1.\nThis means that Eric has used up 33 ozs of water because 12 plus 20 plus 1 equals 33.\nEric has 47 ozs of water left because 80 minus 33 equals <<80-33=47>>47.\n#### 47", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
