{"question": "Anna walks 25 feets every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 feets of walking on the beach and 15 feet(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Anna walks at thrice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 25-feet walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Anna walks at a rate of 10 feets per 60 minutes, or 10/60 = 1/6 feets per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at thrice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 3*1/6 = 0.5 feets per minute.\nTo walk 15 feet(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 15/0.5 = <<15/0.5=30>>30 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Anna 60+30 = <<60+30=90>>90 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 90", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
