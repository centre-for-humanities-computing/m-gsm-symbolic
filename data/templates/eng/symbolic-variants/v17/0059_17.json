{"question": "I have 14 liters of mango drink that are one third water and I wish to add it to 30 liters of peach drink that is three fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill five liters of the mango drink. How much water is in the remaining 39 liters?", "answer": "There are 30*3/5 = <<30*3/5=18>>18 liters of water from the 30 liters peach drink.\nAfter five liters of mango drink was spilled, there were 14-5 = <<14-5=9>>9 liters of mango drink left.\nOut of the 9 liters, 9*1/3 = <<9*1/3=3>>3 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 18 + 3 = <<18+3=21>>21 liters of water out of the 39 liters.\n#### 21", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
