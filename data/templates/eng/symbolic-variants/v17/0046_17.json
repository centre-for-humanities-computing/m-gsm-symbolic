{"question": "Oakwood High School is holding graduation in their Gymnasium this year which has space for 7900 people. After accounting for 700 seats for graduates and 350 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?", "answer": "Add graduate and faculty seats together. 700 + 350 = <<700+350=1050>>1050 seats for faculty and graduates\nMinus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 7900 - 1050 = <<7900-1050=6850>>6850 remaining seats.\nDivide remaining seats by the number of graduates. 6850/700 = <<6850/700=9>>9 tickets\n#### 9", "id_orig": 1031, "id_shuffled": 46}
