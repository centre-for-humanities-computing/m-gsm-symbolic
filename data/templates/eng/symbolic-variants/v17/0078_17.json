{"question": "There are 7 periods in the day for a normal student but Henry has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 60 minutes long. He goes to class for 5 days a week. He then spends 1/2 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 7+2=<<7+2=9>>9 classes a day\nThat means he spends 60*9=<<60*9=540>>540 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 540*5=<<540*5=2700>>2700 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 2700*1/2=<<2700*1/2=1350>>1350 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 2700+1350+1350=<<2700+1350+1350=5400>>5400 minutes per week\nSo he spends 5400/60=<<5400/60=90>>90 hours per week\n#### 90", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
