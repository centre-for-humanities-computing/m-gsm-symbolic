Find the combined total of the number of bananas and oranges Michael has in the house?", "answer": "Before buying any banana and orange, Michael had twice as many bananas as oranges, which is 23 oranges*2 banana/orange = <<23*2=46>>46 bananas\nThe total number of bananas and oranges that Michael had before is 46 bananas + 23 oranges = <<46+23=69>>69 items\nWhen he bought 27 fewer bananas than oranges, he bought 65 bananas - 27 bananas = <<65-27=38>>38 bananas\nIn total, he bought 38 bananas + 65 oranges = <<38+65=103>>103 items\nAfter the purchases, Michael has 69 items + 103 items = <<69+103=172>>172 total bananas and oranges combined.\n#### 172", "id_orig": 406, "id_shuffled": 91}
