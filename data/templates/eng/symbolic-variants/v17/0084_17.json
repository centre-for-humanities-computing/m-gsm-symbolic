{"question": "Madison buys 11 shares of a stock for €46 each. The stock price increases 80% the first year Madison holds it, then decreases 45% in the second year. What is the final value of all Madison's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Madison's purchase: 11 shares * €46/share = €<<11*46=506>>506\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: €506 * 0.8 = €<<506*0.8=404.8>>404\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: €506 + €404.8 = €<<506+404.8=910.8000000000001>>910\nThen multiply that amount by 45% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: €910.8000000000001 * 45% = €<<910.8000000000001*45*.01=409.86>>409\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: €910 - €409 = €<<910-409=500>>500\n#### 500", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
