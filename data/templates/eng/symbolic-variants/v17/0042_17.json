{"question": "Oliver goes to the store to buy some sugar. The normal brand of sugar he buys costs €18 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 10% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses 1 kilogram of sugar per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for €2. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The sugar he bought was 18*0.1=€<<18*0.1=1>>1 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 18+1=€<<18+1=19>>19 per kilogram\nHe goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kilograms of sugar a week\nSo he paid 19.8*7=€<<19.8*7=138>>138 on sugar\nThat means his total bill was 138+2=€<<138+2=140>>140\n#### 140", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
