{"question": "Ava can peel 12 shrimp a minute and saute 20 shrimp in 16 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 120 shrimp?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Ava to peel the shrimp: 120 shrimp / 12 shrimp/minute = <<120/12=10>>10 minutes\nThen find how many batches of shrimp she needs to cook: 120 shrimp / 20 shrimp/batch = <<120/20=6>>6 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 6 batches * 16 minutes/batch = <<6*16=96>>96 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Ava spends: 96 minutes + 10 minutes = <<96+10=106>>106 minutes\n#### 106", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
