{"question": "Olivia is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the hiragana (with 48 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full five times, writes two thirds of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Olivia written in total?", "answer": "Olivia has written the hiragana (with 48 letters) five times which is a total of 48*5=<<48*5=240>>240 letters.\nShe then writes two thirds the hiragana (with 48 letters), which is 48*2/3=<<48*2/3=32>>32 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 240 + 32 = <<240+32=272>>272 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 272 * 2 = <<272*2=544>>544 letters.\n#### 544", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
