What percent of her spools are white?", "answer": "First find the number of white spools: 20 spools + 85 spools = <<20+85=105>>105 spools\nThen find the total number of spools: 55 spools + 85 spools + 105 spools = <<55+85+105=245>>245 spools\nThen divide the number of white spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 105 spools / 245 spools * 100% = 42%\n#### 42", "id_orig": 728, "id_shuffled": 66}
