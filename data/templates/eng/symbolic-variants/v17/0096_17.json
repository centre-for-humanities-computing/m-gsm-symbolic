{"question": "Maya's aunt said that she had £240 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of bowling, have £8 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster twice. A round of bowling is £8. The roller coaster cost £7 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The roller coaster will cost £14 per person because 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14\nEach person costs £30 because 8 + 8 + 14 = <<8+8+14=30>>30\n8 total people can attend because 240 / 30 = <<240/30=8>>8\nShe can invite 7 friends because 8 - 1 =<<8-1=7>>7\n#### 7", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
