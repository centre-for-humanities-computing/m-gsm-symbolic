{"question": "Dr. Patel is looking for a townhouse that will not go beyond her $320,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $310,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 11% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the townhouse than Dr. Patel's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $310,000*5/100 = $<<310,000*5/100=15,500>>15,500.\nThe transfer fee is $310,000*11/100 = $<<310,000*11/100=34,100>>34,100.\nThe total price of the townhouse is $310,000 + $15,500 + $34,100 = $359,600.\nSo, it is $359,600 - $320,000 = $<<359,600-320,000=39,600>>39,600 more than Dr. Patel's budget.\n#### 39,600", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
