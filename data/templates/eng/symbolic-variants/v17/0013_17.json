{"question": "Olivia is an avid gardener. Last night, she received 21 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 3 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Olivia remain with?", "answer": "Last night, before receiving the plants, Olivia had 3*65 = <<3*65=195>>195 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 21 plants, she therefore had a total of 195 + 21 = <<195+21=216>>216 potted plants\nTomorrow, Olivias plant giveaway will be 65*1 = <<65*1=65>>65 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 216 - 65 = <<216-65=151>>151 potted plants.\n#### 151", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
