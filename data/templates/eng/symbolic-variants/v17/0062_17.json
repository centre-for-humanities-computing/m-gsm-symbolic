{"question": "In a set of magician's cards, there are 49 green cards, and 38% more red cards. Orange cards are as many as the sum of green and red cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 38/100 * 49 = <<38/100*49=18>>18 more red cards than green cards.\nWhich means there are 49 + 18 = <<49+18=67>>67 red cards.\nOrange cards make up to 49 + 67 = <<49+67=116>>116 cards.\nSo in total, there are 116 + 116 = <<116+116=232>>232 cards of different colors.\n#### 232", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
