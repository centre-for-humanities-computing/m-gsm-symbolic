{"question": "Tyler watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 60-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 5-hour episodes. If he watched 29 hours of TV in all, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.\nAfter Monday, he had 29 - 3 = <<29-3=26>>26 hours of TV left.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 26 - 3 = <<26-3=23>>23 hours of TV left.\nAfter Thursday, he had 23 - 1 - 1 = 21 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 21 - 20 = 1 hours of TV left.\nEach 45-minute episode is 3/4 hour.\nThus, E = 1/0.75 = 1.3333333333333333 episodes.\n#### 1.3333333333333333", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
