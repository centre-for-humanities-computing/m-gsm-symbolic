{"question": "David collects garbage from 6 different apartment complexes. The first five have 350 apartments each and the last one is 65% bigger than the other five combined. He collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid £0.25 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first five complexes have 5*350=<<5*350=1750>>1750 apartments\nNumber 6 has 1750*0.65=<<1750*0.65=1137.5>>1137 more apartments than those five combined.\nSo in total, it has 1750+1137=<<1750+1137=2887>>2887 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 2887+1750=<<2887+1750=4637.5>>4637 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 4637*5=<<4637*5=23,187.5>>23,187 apartments every week\nSo he makes 23,187*£0.25=£<<23,187*0.25=5796>>5796 every week\n#### 5796", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
