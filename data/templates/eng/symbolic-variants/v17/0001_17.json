{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 176 minutes to cover every 87 miles of the city. If the city is 65 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 65/87 = <<65/87=0>>0 intervals of 176 minutes.\nThus, it will take 0 * 176 = <<0*176=0>>0 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 0", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
