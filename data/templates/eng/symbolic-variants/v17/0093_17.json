{"question": "When the water is cold Carl swims a kilometer in 17 minutes. When the water is warm Carl swims a kilometer in 6 minutes more than twice as long. How much longer does Carl take to swim 4 kilometers on a hot day than a cold day?", "answer": "Cold water kilometer = <<17=17>>17 minutes\nWarm water kilometer = 6+2*17=40 minutes\n4 kilometers in cold water: 4(17)=<<4*17=68>>68 minutes\n4 kilometers in warm water: 4(40)=<<4*40=160>>160 minutes\nCarl takes 160-68=<<160-68=92>>92 minutes longer\n#### 92", "id_orig": 554, "id_shuffled": 93}
