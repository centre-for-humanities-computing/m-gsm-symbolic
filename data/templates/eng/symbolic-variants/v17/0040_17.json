{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $36 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $1 per pound, get 1 pound 1/12 off.\" She scooped up 4 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $3.0 and 8 magnets that were $0.25 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $1 and gets 1 pound 1/12 off. So 1/12 off of 1 pound is $1*1/12 = $0.08333333333333333. The rest of 2 pound does not have discount and costs 2*$1 = $2, so total is $1+$11/12+$2=$47/12\n8 magnets at $0.25 each is 8*0.25=$<<8*0.25=2>>2\nWhen you add all her purchases, 47/12+$3+$2 = $<<47/12+3+2=8>>8\nShe had $36 and spent $8 so she had $36-$8 = $<<36-8=28>>28 left over\n#### 28", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
