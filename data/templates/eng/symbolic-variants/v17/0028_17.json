{"question": "A clinic has a capacity of 1800 beds with 1/3 occupied. Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the clinic each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the clinic after 3 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/3 of the total capacity of the clinic beds is occupied, it means 1/3 * 1800 = <<1800*1/3=600>>600 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the clinic without new admissions is 1800 beds - 600 beds = <<1800-600=1200>>1200 beds.\nIf 20 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the clinic after one week is 20 patients/day * 7 days/week = 140 patients.\nAfter 3 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the clinic is 140 patients/week * 3 weeks = <<140*3=420>>420 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 1200 unoccupied beds in the clinic before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1200 beds - 420 beds = <<1200-420=780>>780 unoccupied beds.\n#### 780", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
