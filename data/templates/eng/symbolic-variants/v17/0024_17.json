{"question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 450 calories per serving. If a 250 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ouncess can you eat if your daily calorie target is 1900 and you have already consumed 1000 calories?", "answer": "If the total calorie target is 1900 and I have consumed 1000 calories then I have 1900-1000 = <<1900-1000=900>>900 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of breads has 450 calories and I only have 900 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 900/450 of a serving = 2 of a serving\nWe also know that a 250 ounces bag of breads has 5 servings, hence each serving has 250 ounces/5 = <<250/5=50>>50 ouncess\nIf I can only eat 2 of a serving, then I can eat only 50 ounces * 2 = 100 ouncess\n#### 100", "id_orig": 43, "id_shuffled": 24}
