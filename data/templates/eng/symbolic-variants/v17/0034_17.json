{"question": "Dr. Jones sold his villa for $830,000. He paid the registration fees that amount to 1% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 4% of the selling price. If he also paid $670,000 for the remaining loan amount of the villa, how much is Dr. Jones's net proceeds from selling the villa?", "answer": "Dr. Jones paid $830,000*1/100 = $8300 for the registration fees.\nHe paid $830,000*4/100 = $33,200 for the realtor fee.\nSo, Dr. Jones paid a total of $8300 + $33,200 + $670,000 = $711,500 for the registration, realtor, and loan fees.\nHence, Dr. Jones's net proceeds is $830,000 - $711,500 = $118,500.\n#### 118,500", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
