{"question": "Joe is selling muffins and banana pie for a fundraiser. On Friday, he sold 21 boxes of muffins and 11 fewer boxes of banana pie, than on Saturday. On Saturday, he sold 15 more boxes of muffins than on Friday and 19 boxes of banana pie. If the muffins cost £9 and the banana pie cost £21, how much did Joe earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 21 + 15 = <<21+15=36>>36 boxes of muffins on Saturday.\nThe total number of boxes of muffins that Joe sold is 21 + 36 = <<21+36=57>>57.\nJoe earned 57*£9 = £<<57*9=513>>513 for selling muffins.\nHe sold 19 - 11 = <<19-11=8>>8 boxes of banana pie on Friday.\nThe total number of boxes of banana pie that Joe sold is 19 + 8 = <<19+8=27>>27.\nHe earned 27*£21 = £<<27*21=567>>567 for selling banana pie.\nSo, Joe earned £513 + £567 = £<<513+567=1080>>1080 for two days.\n#### 1080", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
