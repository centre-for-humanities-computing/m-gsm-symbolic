{"question": "Anna is knitting winter wear for her 2 grandchildren. They're twins, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a vest, sweater, cardigan, leg warmers, and mittens for each of them. It takes 18 skeins of wool to make a vest, 16 for a sweater, 15 for a cardigan, 11 for a pair of leg warmers, and 4 for a pair of mittens. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 18 skeins per vest + 16 skeins per sweater + 15 skeins per cardigan + 11 skeins per pair of leg warmers + 4 skeins per pair of mittens = <<18+16+15+11+4=64>>64 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 2*64 = <<2*64=128>>128 skeins of wool.\n#### 128", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
