How much was the total cost?", "answer": "The total charge for the donuts was 7*$19 = $<<7*19=133>>133.\nThe total charge for the mini cupcakes was 10*$74 = $<<10*74=740>>740.\nThe total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 2*$113 = $<<2*113=226>>226.\nTherefore the total amount Ellen paid for the desserts was $133 + $740 + $226 = $<<133+740+226=1099>>1099.\n#### 1099", "id_orig": 11, "id_shuffled": 36}
