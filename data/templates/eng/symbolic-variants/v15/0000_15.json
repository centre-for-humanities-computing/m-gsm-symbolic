{"question": "Joshua saw a 160-foot dolphin with 4 24-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 24 inches/remora * 4 remoras = <<24*4=96>>96 inches.\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 96 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<96/12=8>>8 foot.\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 8 foot / 160 feet * 100% = 5%\n\n#### 5", "id_orig": 473, "id_shuffled": 0}
