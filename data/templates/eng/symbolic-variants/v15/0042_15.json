{"question": "Noah goes to the store to buy some flour. The normal brand of flour he buys costs £20 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 30% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 1 kilogram of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for £5. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The flour he bought was 20*0.3=£<<20*0.3=6>>6 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 20+6=£<<20+6=26>>26 per kilogram\nHe goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kilograms of flour a week\nSo he paid 26*7=£<<26*7=182>>182 on flour\nThat means his total bill was 182+5=£<<182+5=187>>187\n#### 187", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
