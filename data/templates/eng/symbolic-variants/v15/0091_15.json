{"question": "At Alex's house, there are twice as many apples as kiwis. He has a total of 91 kiwis in his house. Alex bought 70 more kiwis at the store and 37 fewer apples than the number of kiwis. Find the combined total of the number of apples and kiwis Alex has in the house?", "answer": "Before buying any apple and kiwi, Alex had twice as many apples as kiwis, which is 91 kiwis*2 apple/kiwi = <<91*2=182>>182 apples\nThe total number of apples and kiwis that Alex had before is 182 apples + 91 kiwis = <<182+91=273>>273 items\nWhen he bought 37 fewer apples than kiwis, he bought 70 apples - 37 apples = <<70-37=33>>33 apples\nIn total, he bought 33 apples + 70 kiwis = <<33+70=103>>103 items\nAfter the purchases, Alex has 273 items + 103 items = <<273+103=376>>376 total apples and kiwis combined.\n#### 376", "id_orig": 406, "id_shuffled": 91}
