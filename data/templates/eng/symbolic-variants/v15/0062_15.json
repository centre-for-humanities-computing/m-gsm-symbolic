How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 51/100 * 68 = <<51/100*68=34>>34 more yellow cards than purple cards.\nWhich means there are 68 + 34 = <<68+34=102>>102 yellow cards.\nBlue cards make up to 68 + 102 = <<68+102=170>>170 cards.\nSo in total, there are 170 + 170 = <<170+170=340>>340 cards of different colors.\n#### 340", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
