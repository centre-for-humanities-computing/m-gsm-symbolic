{"question": "A group of 194 students has various hobbies. 19 like to dance, 54 like to play swimming, and the rest like to either play music or read. How many like to play music if the number that like to read is twice the number that prefer playing swimming?", "answer": "The number of students that like to read is twice as many as the number who like swimming, so 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108\nThe number that like to play music is 194 total students - 19 that like to dance - 54 that like to play swimming - 108 that like to read = <<194-19-54-108=13>>13\n#### 13", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
