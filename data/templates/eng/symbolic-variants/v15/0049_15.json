{"question": "Kenneth collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. The first two have 200 apartments each and the last one is 65% bigger than the other two combined. He collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.30000000000000004 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first two complexes have 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 apartments\nNumber 3 has 400*0.65=<<400*0.65=260>>260 more apartments than those two combined.\nSo in total, it has 400+260=<<400+260=660>>660 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 660+400=<<660+400=1060>>1060 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 1060*2=<<1060*2=2120>>2120 apartments every week\nSo he makes 2120*€0.30000000000000004=€<<2120*0.30000000000000004=636>>636 every week\n#### 636", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
