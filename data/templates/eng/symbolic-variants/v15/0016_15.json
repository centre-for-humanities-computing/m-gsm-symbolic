{"question": "Bob is selling muffins and strawberry pie for a fundraiser. On Monday, he sold 28 boxes of muffins and 16 fewer boxes of strawberry pie, than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Monday and 18 boxes of strawberry pie. If the muffins cost €13 and the strawberry pie cost €29, how much did Bob earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 28 + 11 = <<28+11=39>>39 boxes of muffins on Tuesday.\nThe total number of boxes of muffins that Bob sold is 28 + 39 = <<28+39=67>>67.\nBob earned 67*€13 = €<<67*13=871>>871 for selling muffins.\nHe sold 18 - 16 = <<18-16=2>>2 boxes of strawberry pie on Monday.\nThe total number of boxes of strawberry pie that Bob sold is 18 + 2 = <<18+2=20>>20.\nHe earned 20*€29 = €<<20*29=580>>580 for selling strawberry pie.\nSo, Bob earned €871 + €580 = €<<871+580=1451>>1451 for two days.\n#### 1451", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
