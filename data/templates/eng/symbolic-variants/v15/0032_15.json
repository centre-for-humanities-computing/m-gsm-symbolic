{"question": "Dr. Patel is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $420,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $410,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 14% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Dr. Patel's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $410,000*5/100 = $<<410,000*5/100=20,500>>20,500.\nThe transfer fee is $410,000*14/100 = $<<410,000*14/100=57,400>>57,400.\nThe total price of the house is $410,000 + $20,500 + $57,400 = $487,900.\nSo, it is $487,900 - $420,000 = $<<487,900-420,000=67,900>>67,900 more than Dr. Patel's budget.\n#### 67,900", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
