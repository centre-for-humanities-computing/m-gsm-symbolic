{"question": "One gnome can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with basic shovel. He can mine twice as much with a nickel pickaxe and 35% more with a titanium pickaxe than with a nickel pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 24 gnomes with titanium pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a gnome can mine with an nickel pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day\nThen multiply that amount by 135% to find how much a gnome can mine with a titanium pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 135% = <<10*135*.01=13>>13 pounds/day\nThen multiply the amount one gnome can mine in a day with a titanium pickaxe by the number of gnomes: 13 pounds/day/gnome * 24 gnomes = <<13*24=324>>324 pounds/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 324 pounds/day * 28 days = <<324*28=9072>>9072 pounds/day\n#### 9072", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
