{"question": "Sophia's mom said that she had £240 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have £3 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts thrice. A round of mini-golf is £6. The go-karts cost £7 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The go-karts will cost £21 per person because 7*3 = <<7*3=21>>21\nEach person costs £30 because 3 + 6 + 21 = <<3+6+21=30>>30\n8 total people can attend because 240 / 30 = <<240/30=8>>8\nShe can invite 7 friends because 8 - 1 =<<8-1=7>>7\n#### 7", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
