{"question": "Michael hires a boat from 5 PM to 10 PM. He gets 1 hour(s) free. The first paid hour is €43 and each hour after that is five times the cost. How much did he pay?", "answer": "He got it for 10-5=<<10-5=5>>5 hours\nHe pays for 5-1=<<5-1=4>>4 hours\nThe first hour cost 1*43=€<<1*43=43>>43\nThe other 4-1=3 hours are more expensive\nThey cost 43*5=€<<43*5=215>>215 per hour\nSo those 3 hours cost 3*215=€<<3*215=645>>645\nSo he pays 645+43=€<<645+43=688>>688 in total\n#### 688", "id_orig": 652, "id_shuffled": 89}
