{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $13 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $1 per pound, get 1 pound 1/16 off.\" She scooped up 5 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.5 and 10 magnets that were $0.25 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $1 and gets 1 pound 1/16 off. So 1/16 off of 1 pound is $1*1/16 = $0.0625. The rest of 3 pound does not have discount and costs 3*$1 = $3, so total is $1+$15/16+$3=$79/16\n10 magnets at $0.25 each is 10*0.25=$<<10*0.25=2.5>>2.5\nWhen you add all her purchases, 79/16+$1.5+$2.5 = $<<79/16+1.5+2.5=8>>8\nShe had $13 and spent $8 so she had $13-$8 = $<<13-8=5>>5 left over\n#### 5", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
