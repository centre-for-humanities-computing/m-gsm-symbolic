{"question": "Bob caught 5 steelheads last Wednesday, the first steelhead he caught weighs 71 kgs, the second steelhead he caught weighs 53 kgs, and the remaining steelhead he caught weighs 32 kgs. If a kg of steelhead costs £2.5, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?", "answer": "Bob will earn 71*£2.5 = £<<71*2.5=177.5>>177.5 from the first steelhead.\nHe will earn 53*£2.5 = £<<53*2.5=132.5>>132.5 for the second steelhead.\nThe rest of the steelheads are 5-2 = <<5-2=3>>3. He will earn 32*£2.5 = £<<32*2.5=80>>80 per each of them. So he will earn 3 * 80 = <<3*80>>=240\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the steelheads is £177.5 + £132.5 + £240= £<<177.5+132.5+240=550>>550.\n#### 550", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
