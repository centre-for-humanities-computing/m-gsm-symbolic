{"question": "Emma qualified for a spot on the cycling team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a sports bra for $22, a pair of cycling shorts for $9 more than the sports bra cost, and a pair of cleats that were originally $66 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for $2 off the package of $5 athletic headbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The shorts were $9 more than the sports bra, so they cost $9 + $22 = $<<9+22=31>>31.\nHer cleats were half the original $66 price, so they cost $66*1/2=$33.\nWith her coupon, the headbands were $5 - $2 = $<<5-2=3>>3.\nThe sports bra, shorts, cleats, and headbands together cost $22 + $31 + $33 + $3 = $<<22+31+33+3=89>>89.\n#### 89", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
