If they work 11 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?", "answer": "They have to clean 35 floors a day because 210 / 6 = <<210/6=35>>35\nThey spend 525 minutes cleaning per day because 35*15 = <<35*15=525>>525\nThey spend 8.75 hours a day because 525 / 60 = <<525/60=8.75>>8.75\nThey spend 35/44 of their day cleaning floors because 8.75 / 11 = <<8.75/11=0.7954545454545454>>0.7954545454545454\nThey spend 79% of their day cleaning floors because 0.7954545454545454*100 = <<0.7954545454545454*100=79>>79\n#### 79", "id_orig": 1239, "id_shuffled": 39}
