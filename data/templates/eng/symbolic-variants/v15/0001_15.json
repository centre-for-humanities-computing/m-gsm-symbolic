{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 277 minutes to cover every 63 miles of the city. If the city is 97 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 97/63 = <<97/63=1>>1 intervals of 277 minutes.\nThus, it will take 1 * 277 = <<1*277=277>>277 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 277", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
