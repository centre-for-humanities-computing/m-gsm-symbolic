{"question": "Ashley buys 5 shares of a stock for £68 each. The stock price increases 80% the first year Ashley holds it, then decreases 35% in the second year. What is the final value of all Ashley's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Ashley's purchase: 5 shares * £68/share = £<<5*68=340>>340\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: £340 * 0.8 = £<<340*0.8=272>>272\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: £340 + £272 = £<<340+272=612>>612\nThen multiply that amount by 35% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: £612 * 35% = £<<612*35*.01=214.2>>214\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: £612 - £214 = £<<612-214=397>>397\n#### 397", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
