{"question": "Abby and Ava are sisters from Phoenix who love collecting signatures from athletes. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 4 weeks, Abby and Ava compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Abby has 22 signatures in her book, and Ava has 40. The sisters have 3 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 125 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Abby and Ava have already collected 22 + 40 signatures = <<22+40=62>>62 signatures.\nSince their goal is 125, they need to collect 125 - 62 signatures. 125 - 62 = <<125-62=63>>63 signatures\n#### 63", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
