{"question": "Oliver's car breaks down. The car weighs 2500 kilograms and he has furniture in it weighing 375 kilograms. He also has his four young colleagues who weigh 75 kilograms each in it. If the force to move the car is 1% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the car?", "answer": "His four colleagues weigh 75*4=<<75*4=300>>300 kilograms\nSo the total weight of the car and everything is 2500+375+300=<<2500+375+300=3175>>3175 kilograms\nSo he needs to generate 3175*0.01=<<3175*0.01=31>>31 kilograms\n#### 31", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
