{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys a variety of wheats, hay, carrots and apples. Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys six 3-pounds boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the cows while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 8-pounds bags. Wheats are the main diet of his cows, so he buys forty-two 75-pounds packs. Hay are a staple to supplement the wheats, so he buys twenty 50-pounds sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2100 poundss at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 poundss of apples.\nHe is buying 4*8 = <<4*8=32>>32 poundss of carrots.\nHe is buying 20*50 = <<20*50=1000>>1000 poundss of hay.\nHe is buying 42*75 = <<42*75=3150>>3150 poundss of wheats.\nThe weight of all the feed is 18 + 32 + 1000 + 3150 = <<18+32+1000+3150=4200>>4200 poundss.\nThus, the farmer needs 4200 / 2100 = <<4200/2100=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
