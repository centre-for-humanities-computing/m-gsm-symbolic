{"question": "Olivia can peel 9 clams a minute and saute 20 clams in 19 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 180 clams?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Olivia to peel the clams: 180 clams / 9 clams/minute = <<180/9=20>>20 minutes\nThen find how many batches of clams she needs to cook: 180 clams / 20 clams/batch = <<180/20=9>>9 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 9 batches * 19 minutes/batch = <<9*19=171>>171 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Olivia spends: 171 minutes + 20 minutes = <<171+20=191>>191 minutes\n#### 191", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
