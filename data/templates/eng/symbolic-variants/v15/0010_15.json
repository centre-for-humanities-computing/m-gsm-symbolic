{"question": "To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay £0.5 for each minute of your call. After 18 minutes, that price drops to £0.25 per minute. How much would a 50-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 18 minutes would be a cost of 18 * 0.5 = £<<18*0.5=9>>9.\nAfter that, there are 50 - 18 = <<50-18=32>>32 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 32 minutes cost 32 * 0.25 = £<<32*0.25=8>>8.\nSo in total, the 50-minute call would cost 9 + 8 = £17.\n#### 17", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
