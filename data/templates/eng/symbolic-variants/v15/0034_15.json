{"question": "Mr. Williams sold his apartment for $600,000. He paid the legal fees that amount to 1% of the selling price and also paid a agent fee that is 2% of the selling price. If he also paid $510,000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment, how much is Mr. Williams's net proceeds from selling the apartment?", "answer": "Mr. Williams paid $600,000*1/100 = $6000 for the legal fees.\nHe paid $600,000*2/100 = $12,000 for the agent fee.\nSo, Mr. Williams paid a total of $6000 + $12,000 + $510,000 = $528,000 for the legal, agent, and loan fees.\nHence, Mr. Williams's net proceeds is $600,000 - $528,000 = $72,000.\n#### 72,000", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
