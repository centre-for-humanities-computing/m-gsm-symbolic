{"question": "In Dr. Lee's class of 25 students, 11% of the class are basketball players. Out of the remaining class, 35% of the students are choir members or part of robotics club members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away meet. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "11% of the 25 student class are basketball players so that's 0.11*25 = <<0.11*25=2>>2 students\nThere are 25 students and 2 are basketball players so that leaves 25-2 = <<25-2=23>>23 students\n35% of the remaining 23 students are part of robotics club members or choir members so that's 0.35*23 = <<0.35*23=8>>8 students\n2 students are basketball players and 8 are part of robotics club members/choir members so 2+8 = <<2+8=10>>10 students will be leaving early\n#### 10", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
