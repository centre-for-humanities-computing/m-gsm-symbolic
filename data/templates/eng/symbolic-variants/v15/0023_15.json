{"question": "Ashley is knitting winter wear for her 2 grandchildren. They're twins, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a hat, vest, tunic, mittens, and socks for each of them. It takes 18 skeins of wool to make a hat, 8 for a vest, 17 for a tunic, 5 for a pair of mittens, and 13 for a pair of socks. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 18 skeins per hat + 8 skeins per vest + 17 skeins per tunic + 5 skeins per pair of mittens + 13 skeins per pair of socks = <<18+8+17+5+13=61>>61 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 2*61 = <<2*61=122>>122 skeins of wool.\n#### 122", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
