{"question": "In a 70-item quiz, 20% of the questions are geometry, and the rest are equally divided as literature and algebra questions. If Abby is sure to get 25% of the geometry questions, and one quarter of the literature and algebra questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?", "answer": "The literature and algebra questions comprises 100% - 20% = 80% of the quiz.\nThere are 70 questions*20/100 = <<70*20/100=14>>14 geometry questions.\nThere are a total of 70 questions*80/100 = <<70*80/100=56>>56 literature and algebra questions.\nIf Abby is sure to get 25% of the geometry questions, then this means she is sure of her 14 questions*25/100 = <<14*25/100=3>>3 points.\nFrom the literature and algebra questions, she is sure to get one quarter of it correctly so that is 56 questions*1/4 = <<56*1/4=14>>14 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 3 points + 14 points = <<3+14=17>>17 points in her quiz.\n#### 17", "id_orig": 1021, "id_shuffled": 19}
