{"question": "Alex watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Wednesday and Thursday, he watched a 6-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Friday, he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show. On Saturday, he finished homework early and watched a 6-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Sunday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. If he watched 30 hours of TV in all, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Friday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Friday.\nAfter Wednesday, he had 30 - 6 = <<30-6=24>>24 hours of TV left.\nAfter Thursday, he had 24 - 6 = <<24-6=18>>18 hours of TV left.\nAfter Saturday, he had 18 - 6 - 0.5 = 11.5 hours of TV left.\nAfter Sunday, he had 11.5 - 6 = 5.5 hours of TV left.\nEach 45-minute episode is 3/4 hour.\nThus, E = 5.5/0.75 = 7.333333333333333 episodes.\n#### 7.333333333333333", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
