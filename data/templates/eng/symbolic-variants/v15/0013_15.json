{"question": "Amanda is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 21 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 10 potted plants on each of the 43 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 2 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Amanda remain with?", "answer": "Two days ago, before receiving the plants, Amanda had 10*43 = <<10*43=430>>430 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 21 plants, she therefore had a total of 430 + 21 = <<430+21=451>>451 potted plants\nTomorrow, Amandas plant giveaway will be 43*2 = <<43*2=86>>86 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 451 - 86 = <<451-86=365>>365 potted plants.\n#### 365", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
