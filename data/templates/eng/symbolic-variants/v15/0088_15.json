{"question": "Sarah can run thrice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking?", "answer": "If Sarah can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is thrice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/3=2 miles per hour.\nIf half of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 4*1/2=<<4*1/2=2>>2 hours.\nIf half of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.\nShe walks for 2 hours at 2 miles per hour, or 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 12+4=<<12+4=16>>16 miles.\n#### 16", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
