{"question": "A hospital has a capacity of 1400 beds with 1/8 occupied. Due to the flu season, 35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 4 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/8 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/8 * 1400 = <<1400*1/8=175>>175 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1400 beds - 175 beds = <<1400-175=1225>>1225 beds.\nIf 35 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 35 patients/day * 7 days/week = 245 patients.\nAfter 4 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 245 patients/week * 4 weeks = <<245*4=980>>980 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 1225 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1225 beds - 980 beds = <<1225-980=245>>245 unoccupied beds.\n#### 245", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
