{"question": "A virus infects twelve people. Every day, each infected person infects five others. How many people are infected after three days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original twelve people infect five people each, so 12*5 = <<12*5=60>>60 more people are infected.\nThere are 12+60 = <<12+60=72>>72 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 72*5 = <<72*5=360>>360 more people are infected.\nThere are 72 + 360 = <<72+360=432>>432 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 432*5 = 2160 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 432 + 2160 = 2592 infected people after three days.\n#### 2592", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
