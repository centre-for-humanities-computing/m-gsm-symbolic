{"question": "Joshua is feeding his livestock grain. Each horse needs 13 kg, and each alpaca needs 6 kg less than twice the amount each horse needs. If there are 30 horses and 46 alpacas, how many kg of grain does Joshua need?", "answer": "First figure out how much grain each alpaca needs: 13 kg * 2 - 6 = <<13*2-6=20>>20 kg/alpaca\nNow figure out how much grain total the alpacas need: 20 kg/alpaca * 46 alpacas = <<20*46=920>>920 kg\nNow figure out how much grain total the horses need: 13 kg/horse * 30 horses = <<13*30=390>>390 kg\nNow add the two amounts of grain to find the total: 920 kg + 390 kg = <<920+390=1310>>1310 kg\n#### 1310", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
