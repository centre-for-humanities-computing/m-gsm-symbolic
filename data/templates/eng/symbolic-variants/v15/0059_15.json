{"question": "I have 9 liters of lemon drink that are one third water and I wish to add it to 24 liters of peach drink that is one third water. But as I pour it, I spill three liters of the lemon drink. How much water is in the remaining 30 liters?", "answer": "There are 24*1/3 = <<24*1/3=8>>8 liters of water from the 24 liters peach drink.\nAfter three liters of lemon drink was spilled, there were 9-3 = <<9-3=6>>6 liters of lemon drink left.\nOut of the 6 liters, 6*1/3 = <<6*1/3=2>>2 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10 liters of water out of the 30 liters.\n#### 10", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
