{"question": "The vending machines sell gum for 35 cents and popcorn for 115 cents. Oliver spent $13 and got 9 bags of gum and had 5% of his money left in change. How many popcorn did he buy?", "answer": "Oliver got $0.65 in change because $13*5/100 = <<13*5/100=0.65>>0.65\nOliver spent $12.35 because 13 - 0.65 = <<13-0.65=12.35>>12.35\nOliver spent $3.15 on gum because 9*0.35 = <<9*0.35=3.15>>3.15\nOliver spent 9.2 on popcorn because 12.35 - 3.15 = <<12.35-3.15=9.2>>9.2\nOliver bought 8 popcorn because 9.2 / 1.15 = <<8=8>>8\n#### 8", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
