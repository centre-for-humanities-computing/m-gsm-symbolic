{"question": "Laura is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire one financial advisor. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 8 fewer hours of contract work, losing $95/hour in missed income. The financial advisor charges $52. How much more money will she have if she hires the financial advisor?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Laura does her taxes herself: $95/hour * 8 hours = $<<95*8=760>>760\nThen subtract the financial advisor's charge to find how much money Laura saves: $760 - $52 = $<<760-52=708>>708\n#### 708", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
