{"question": "At the beginning of the conference, there were 32 lawyers and 19 engineers. After an hour, 1/3 of the total number of people left. How many engineers are left if 17 lawyers stayed at the conference?", "answer": "There were a total of 32 lawyers + 19 engineers = <<32+19=51>>51 people who attended the conference.\nAfter an hour, 51 people * 1/3 = <<51*1/3=17>>17 people left the conference.\nThis means 51 people - 17 people = <<51-17=34>>34 people stayed.\nOut of the 34 who stayed, 34 people - 17 lawyers = <<34-17=17>>17 were engineers.\n#### 17", "id_orig": 320, "id_shuffled": 82}
