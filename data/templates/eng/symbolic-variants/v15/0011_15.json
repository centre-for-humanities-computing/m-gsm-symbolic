{"question": "Kenneth wants to make different sized ice cubes with 92 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 6 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 3 ounces, and small cubes that use 1/3 ounce. If he makes 7 giant cubes, 7 medium cubes, and 15 small cubes, how many ounces of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 42 ounces of water because 7 times 6 equals <<7*6=42>>42.\nThe medium cubes used up 21 ounces of water because 7 times 3 equals <<7*3=21>>21.\nThe small cubes used up 5 ounces of water because 15 times 1/3 equals 5.\nThis means that Kenneth has used up 68 ounces of water because 42 plus 21 plus 5 equals 68.\nKenneth has 24 ounces of water left because 92 minus 68 equals <<92-68=24>>24.\n#### 24", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
