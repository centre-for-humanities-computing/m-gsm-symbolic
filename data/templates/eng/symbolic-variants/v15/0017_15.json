{"question": "Lily walks 21 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 8 miles of walking on the beach and 13 mile(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Lily walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 21-mile walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Lily walks at a rate of 8 miles per 64 minutes, or 8/64 = 1/8 miles per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/8 = 0.25 miles per minute.\nTo walk 13 mile(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 13/0.25 = <<13/0.25=52>>52 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Lily 64+52 = <<64+52=116>>116 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 116", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
