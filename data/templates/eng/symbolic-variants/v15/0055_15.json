{"question": "Amanda is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the hiragana (with 48 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full five times, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Amanda written in total?", "answer": "Amanda has written the hiragana (with 48 letters) five times which is a total of 48*5=<<48*5=240>>240 letters.\nShe then writes half the hiragana (with 48 letters), which is 48*1/2=<<48*1/2=24>>24 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 240 + 24 = <<240+24=264>>264 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 264 * 2 = <<264*2=528>>528 letters.\n#### 528", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
