{"question": "If Isabella and David have 800 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with David getting 80 feet more than Isabella, how much is left over for Isabella?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Isabella gets and y be the amount David gets. We know that y = x + 80, and y + x = 800.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+80=800\nSubtracting the 80 from both sides, we get 2x=720\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=360. This means Isabella has 360 feet of fence left over.\n#### 360", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
