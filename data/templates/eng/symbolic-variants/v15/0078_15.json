{"question": "There are 9 periods in the day for a normal student but Tyler has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 45 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends 1/6 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 9+2=<<9+2=11>>11 classes a day\nThat means he spends 45*11=<<45*11=495>>495 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 495*4=<<495*4=1980>>1980 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1980*1/6=<<1980*1/6=330>>330 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 1980+330+330=<<1980+330+330=2640>>2640 minutes per week\nSo he spends 2640/60=<<2640/60=44>>44 hours per week\n#### 44", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
