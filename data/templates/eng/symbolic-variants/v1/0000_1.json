{"question": "Jessica saw a 300-foot shark with 9 4-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 4 inches/remora * 9 remoras = <<4*9=36>>36 inches.\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 36 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<36/12=3>>3 foot.\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 3 foot / 300 feet * 100% = 1%\n\n#### 1", "id_orig": 473, "id_shuffled": 0}
