{"question": "There are 5 periods in the day for a normal student but Chris has to take 4 extra classes. Each class is 60 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/4 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 5+4=<<5+4=9>>9 classes a day\nThat means he spends 60*9=<<60*9=540>>540 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 540*6=<<540*6=3240>>3240 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 3240*1/4=<<3240*1/4=810>>810 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 3240+810+810=<<3240+810+810=4860>>4860 minutes per week\nSo he spends 4860/60=<<4860/60=81>>81 hours per week\n#### 81", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
