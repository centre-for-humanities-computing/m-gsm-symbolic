{"question": "Madison qualified for a spot on the soccer team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a t-shirt for €22, a pair of soccer leggings for €5 more than the t-shirt cost, and a pair of cleats that were originally €30 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for €4 off the package of €13 athletic headbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The leggings were €5 more than the t-shirt, so they cost €5 + €22 = €<<5+22=27>>27.\nHer cleats were half the original €30 price, so they cost €30*1/2=€15.\nWith her coupon, the headbands were €13 - €4 = €<<13-4=9>>9.\nThe t-shirt, leggings, cleats, and headbands together cost €22 + €27 + €15 + €9 = €<<22+27+15+9=73>>73.\n#### 73", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
