{"question": "Sarah buys 19 shares of a stock for €20 each. The stock price increases 60% the first year Sarah holds it, then decreases 5% in the second year. What is the final value of all Sarah's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Sarah's purchase: 19 shares * €20/share = €<<19*20=380>>380\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: €380 * 0.6 = €<<380*0.6=228>>228\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: €380 + €228 = €<<380+228=608>>608\nThen multiply that amount by 5% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: €608 * 5% = €<<608*5*.01=30.4>>30\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: €608 - €30 = €<<608-30=577>>577\n#### 577", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
