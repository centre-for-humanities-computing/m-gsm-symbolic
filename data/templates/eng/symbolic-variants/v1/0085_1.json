{"question": "If Emily and Claire have 400 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Claire getting 160 feet more than Emily, how much is left over for Emily?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Emily gets and y be the amount Claire gets. We know that y = x + 160, and y + x = 400.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+160=400\nSubtracting the 160 from both sides, we get 2x=240\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=120. This means Emily has 120 feet of fence left over.\n#### 120", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
