{"question": "Maya walks 15 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 5 miles of walking on the beach and 10 mile(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Maya walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 15-mile walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Maya walks at a rate of 5 miles per 40 minutes, or 5/40 = 1/8 miles per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/8 = 0.25 miles per minute.\nTo walk 10 mile(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 10/0.25 = <<10/0.25=40>>40 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Maya 40+40 = <<40+40=80>>80 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 80", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
