If he also paid $450,000 for the remaining loan amount of the cottage, how much is Dr. Garcia's net proceeds from selling the cottage?", "answer": "Dr. Garcia paid $640,000*2/100 = $12,800 for the transfer fees.\nHe paid $640,000*5/100 = $32,000 for the brokerage fee.\nSo, Dr. Garcia paid a total of $12,800 + $32,000 + $450,000 = $494,800 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.\nHence, Dr. Garcia's net proceeds is $640,000 - $494,800 = $145,200.\n#### 145,200", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
