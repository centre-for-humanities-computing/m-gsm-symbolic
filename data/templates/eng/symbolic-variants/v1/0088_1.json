{"question": "Maya can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is three fifths as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?", "answer": "If Maya can skip at three fifths the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*5/3=<<6*5/3=10>>10 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 10/2=5 miles per hour.\nIf two thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*2/3=<<6*2/3=4>>4 hours.\nIf one third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 10 miles per hour, or 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 miles.\nShe walks for 4 hours at 5 miles per hour, or 4*5=<<4*5=20>>20 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 20+20=<<20+20=40>>40 miles.\n#### 40", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
