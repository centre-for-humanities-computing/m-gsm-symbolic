{"question": "In Mr. Smith's class of 57 students, 29% of the class are soccer players. Out of the remaining class, 39% of the students are dancers or part of debate team members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "29% of the 57 student class are soccer players so that's 0.29*57 = <<0.29*57=16>>16 students\nThere are 57 students and 16 are soccer players so that leaves 57-16 = <<57-16=41>>41 students\n39% of the remaining 41 students are part of debate team members or dancers so that's 0.39*41 = <<0.39*41=15>>15 students\n16 students are soccer players and 15 are part of debate team members/dancers so 16+15 = <<16+15=32>>32 students will be leaving early\n#### 32", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
