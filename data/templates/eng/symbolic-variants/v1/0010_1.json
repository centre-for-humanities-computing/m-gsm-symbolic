{"question": "To make a call from a phone booth, you must pay $0.5 for each minute of your call. After 26 minutes, that price drops to $0.25 per minute. How much would a 69-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 26 minutes would be a cost of 26 * 0.5 = $<<26*0.5=13>>13.\nAfter that, there are 69 - 26 = <<69-26=43>>43 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 43 minutes cost 43 * 0.25 = $<<43*0.25=10>>10.\nSo in total, the 69-minute call would cost 13 + 10 = $23.\n#### 23", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
