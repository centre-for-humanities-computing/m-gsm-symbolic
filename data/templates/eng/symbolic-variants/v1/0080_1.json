{"question": "The vending machines sell popcorn for 90 cents and gum for 125 cents. Carl spent €13 and got 4 bags of popcorn and had 5% of his money left in change. How many gum did he buy?", "answer": "Carl got €0.65 in change because €13*5/100 = <<13*5/100=0.65>>0.65\nCarl spent €12.35 because 13 - 0.65 = <<13-0.65=12.35>>12.35\nCarl spent €3.6 on popcorn because 4*0.9 = <<4*0.9=3.6>>3.6\nCarl spent 8.75 on gum because 12.35 - 3.6 = <<12.35-3.6=8.75>>8.75\nCarl bought 7 gum because 8.75 / 1.25 = <<7=7>>7\n#### 7", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
