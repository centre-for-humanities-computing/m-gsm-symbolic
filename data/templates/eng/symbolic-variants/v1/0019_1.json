{"question": "In a 50-item quiz, 60% of the questions are chemistry, and the rest are equally divided as geography and literature questions. If Andrea is sure to get 90% of the chemistry questions, and one fifth of the geography and literature questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?", "answer": "The geography and literature questions comprises 100% - 60% = 40% of the quiz.\nThere are 50 questions*60/100 = <<50*60/100=30>>30 chemistry questions.\nThere are a total of 50 questions*40/100 = <<50*40/100=20>>20 geography and literature questions.\nIf Andrea is sure to get 90% of the chemistry questions, then this means she is sure of her 30 questions*90/100 = <<30*90/100=27>>27 points.\nFrom the geography and literature questions, she is sure to get one fifth of it correctly so that is 20 questions*1/5 = <<20*1/5=4>>4 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 27 points + 4 points = <<27+4=31>>31 points in her quiz.\n#### 31", "id_orig": 1021, "id_shuffled": 19}
