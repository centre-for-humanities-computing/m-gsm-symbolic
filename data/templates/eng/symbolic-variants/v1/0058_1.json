{"question": "One troll can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe and 55% more with a mithril pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 20 trolls with mithril pickaxes mine in a month with 29 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a troll can mine with an bronze pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day\nThen multiply that amount by 155% to find how much a troll can mine with a mithril pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 155% = <<10*155*.01=15>>15 pounds/day\nThen multiply the amount one troll can mine in a day with a mithril pickaxe by the number of trolls: 15 pounds/day/troll * 20 trolls = <<15*20=310>>310 pounds/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 310 pounds/day * 29 days = <<310*29=8990>>8990 pounds/day\n#### 8990", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
