{"question": "Oliver goes to the store to buy some flour. The normal brand of flour he buys costs €7 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 10% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 2 kilogram of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a cookie for €2. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The flour he bought was 7*0.1=€<<7*0.1=0>>0 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 7+0=€<<7+0=7>>7 per kilogram\nHe goes through 2*7=<<2*7=14>>14 kilograms of flour a week\nSo he paid 7.7*14=€<<7.7*14=107>>107 on flour\nThat means his total bill was 107+2=€<<107+2=109>>109\n#### 109", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
