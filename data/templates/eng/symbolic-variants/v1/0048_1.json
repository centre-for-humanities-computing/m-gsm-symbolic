{"question": "Maya can peel 5 mushrooms a minute and saute 35 mushrooms in 6 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 70 mushrooms?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Maya to peel the mushrooms: 70 mushrooms / 5 mushrooms/minute = <<70/5=14>>14 minutes\nThen find how many batches of mushrooms she needs to cook: 70 mushrooms / 35 mushrooms/batch = <<70/35=2>>2 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 2 batches * 6 minutes/batch = <<2*6=12>>12 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Maya spends: 12 minutes + 14 minutes = <<12+14=26>>26 minutes\n#### 26", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
