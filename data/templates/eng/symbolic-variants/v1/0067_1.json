{"question": "Bob's car breaks down. The car weighs 2550 pounds and he has furniture in it weighing 200 pounds. He also has his four young children who weigh 70 pounds each in it. If the force to move the car is 2% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the car?", "answer": "His four children weigh 70*4=<<70*4=280>>280 pounds\nSo the total weight of the car and everything is 2550+200+280=<<2550+200+280=3030>>3030 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 3030*0.02=<<3030*0.02=60>>60 pounds\n#### 60", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
