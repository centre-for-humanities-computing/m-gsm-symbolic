{"question": "Noah watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Sunday and Monday, he watched a 5-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Tuesday, he watched a few episodes of a 60-minute show. On Wednesday, he finished homework early and watched a 2-hour episode and a 15-minute show. On Thursday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 2-hour episodes. If he watched 23 hours of TV in all, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Tuesday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Tuesday.\nAfter Sunday, he had 23 - 5 = <<23-5=18>>18 hours of TV left.\nAfter Monday, he had 18 - 5 = <<18-5=13>>13 hours of TV left.\nAfter Wednesday, he had 13 - 2 - 0.25 = 10.75 hours of TV left.\nAfter Thursday, he had 10.75 - 6 = 4.75 hours of TV left.\nEach 60-minute episode is 1 hour.\nThus, E = 4.75/1 = 4.75 episodes.\n#### 4.75", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
