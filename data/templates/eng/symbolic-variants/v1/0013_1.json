{"question": "Emily is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 31 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 7 potted plants on each of the 67 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Emily remain with?", "answer": "Two days ago, before receiving the plants, Emily had 7*67 = <<7*67=469>>469 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 31 plants, she therefore had a total of 469 + 31 = <<469+31=500>>500 potted plants\nTomorrow, Emilys plant giveaway will be 67*1 = <<67*1=67>>67 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 500 - 67 = <<500-67=433>>433 potted plants.\n#### 433", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
