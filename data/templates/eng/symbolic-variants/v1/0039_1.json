{"question": "A cleaner has to clean a office building with 90 rooms. They have 10 days to get it done. It takes them 30 minutes per room. If they work 9 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?", "answer": "They have to clean 9 rooms a day because 90 / 10 = <<90/10=9>>9\nThey spend 270 minutes cleaning per day because 9*30 = <<9*30=270>>270\nThey spend 4.5 hours a day because 270 / 60 = <<270/60=4.5>>4.5\nThey spend 1/2 of their day cleaning rooms because 4.5 / 9 = <<4.5/9=0.5>>0.5\nThey spend 50% of their day cleaning rooms because 0.5*100 = <<0.5*100=50>>50\n#### 50", "id_orig": 1239, "id_shuffled": 39}
