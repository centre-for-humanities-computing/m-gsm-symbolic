{"question": "Kenneth is feeding his livestock grain. Each cow needs 11 kg, and each donkey needs 6 kg less than twice the amount each cow needs. If there are 16 cows and 21 donkeys, how many kg of grain does Kenneth need?", "answer": "First figure out how much grain each donkey needs: 11 kg * 2 - 6 = <<11*2-6=16>>16 kg/donkey\nNow figure out how much grain total the donkeys need: 16 kg/donkey * 21 donkeys = <<16*21=336>>336 kg\nNow figure out how much grain total the cows need: 11 kg/cow * 16 cows = <<11*16=176>>176 kg\nNow add the two amounts of grain to find the total: 336 kg + 176 kg = <<336+176=512>>512 kg\n#### 512", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
