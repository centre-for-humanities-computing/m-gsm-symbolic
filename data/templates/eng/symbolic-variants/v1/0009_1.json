The tower of stacking rings has 29 multicolored rings on it. Olivia recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her cousin up to 157. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Olivia has 46 + 32 + 29 + T = 107 + T = 157 toys for her cousin.\nThus, T = 157 - 107 = <<157-107=50>>50 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 50", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
