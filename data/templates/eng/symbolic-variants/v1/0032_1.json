{"question": "Mrs. Smith is looking for a apartment that will not go beyond her $390,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $380,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 7% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 10% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the apartment than Mrs. Smith's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $380,000*7/100 = $<<380,000*7/100=26,600>>26,600.\nThe transfer fee is $380,000*10/100 = $<<380,000*10/100=38,000>>38,000.\nThe total price of the apartment is $380,000 + $26,600 + $38,000 = $444,600.\nSo, it is $444,600 - $390,000 = $<<444,600-390,000=54,600>>54,600 more than Mrs. Smith's budget.\n#### 54,600", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
