{"question": "A group of 155 students has various hobbies. 135 like to play video games, 3 like to play running, and the rest like to either hike or bake. How many like to hike if the number that like to bake is twice the number that prefer playing running?", "answer": "The number of students that like to bake is twice as many as the number who like running, so 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6\nThe number that like to hike is 155 total students - 135 that like to play video games - 3 that like to play running - 6 that like to bake = <<155-135-3-6=11>>11\n#### 11", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
