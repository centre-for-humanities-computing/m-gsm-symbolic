{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Neptunes Kingdom is 280 yards long, and people slide down at 60 yards/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 230 yards long, but steeper, so people slide down at 85 yards/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 280 yards / 60 yards/minute = <<280/60=4>>4 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 230 yards / 85 yards/minute = <<230/85=2>>2 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 4 minutes - 2 minutes = <<4-2=2>>2 minutes\n#### 2", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
