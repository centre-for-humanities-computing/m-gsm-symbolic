{"question": "I have 14 liters of mango drink that are half water and I wish to add it to 28 liters of lemon drink that is three quarters water. But as I pour it, I spill six liters of the mango drink. How much water is in the remaining 36 liters?", "answer": "There are 28*3/4 = <<28*3/4=21>>21 liters of water from the 28 liters lemon drink.\nAfter six liters of mango drink was spilled, there were 14-6 = <<14-6=8>>8 liters of mango drink left.\nOut of the 8 liters, 8*1/2 = <<8*1/2=4>>4 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 21 + 4 = <<21+4=25>>25 liters of water out of the 36 liters.\n#### 25", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
