{"question": "Jason has a bag of beads with 96 inside. He tripped over a toy while carrying it and dropped three quarters of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 7. When he went back home, he inspected the beads further. Three of the ones he picked up weren't beads, but actually buttons so he got rid of them. How many beads did Jason end up with?", "answer": "Jason dropped his beads and was left with 96*1/4=<<96*1/4=24>>24 beads.\nHe searched and found some of his lost beads, getting him back to 24+7=<<24+7=31>>31 beads.\nHe went home and removed three buttons, leaving him with 31-3=<<31-3=28>>28 beads.\n#### 28", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
