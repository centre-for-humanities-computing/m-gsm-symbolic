{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $28 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $2 per pound, get 1 pound 1/10 off.\" She scooped up 6 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $2.0 and 6 magnets that were $1.0 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $2 and gets 1 pound 1/10 off. So 1/10 off of 1 pound is $2*1/10 = $0.2. The rest of 4 pound does not have discount and costs 4*$2 = $8, so total is $2+$9/5+$8=$59/5\n6 magnets at $1 each is 6*1=$<<6*1=6>>6\nWhen you add all her purchases, 59/5+$2+$6 = $<<59/5+2+6=19>>19\nShe had $28 and spent $19 so she had $28-$19 = $<<28-19=9>>9 left over\n#### 9", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
