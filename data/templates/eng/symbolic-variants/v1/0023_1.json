{"question": "Emily is knitting winter wear for her 5 grandchildren. They're quintuplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a shawl, hat, poncho, booties, and gloves for each of them. It takes 14 skeins of wool to make a shawl, 15 for a hat, 7 for a poncho, 10 for a pair of booties, and 11 for a pair of gloves. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 14 skeins per shawl + 15 skeins per hat + 7 skeins per poncho + 10 skeins per pair of booties + 11 skeins per pair of gloves = <<14+15+7+10+11=57>>57 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 5*57 = <<5*57=285>>285 skeins of wool.\n#### 285", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
