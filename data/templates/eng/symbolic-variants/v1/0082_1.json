{"question": "At the beginning of the party, there were 55 doctors and 75 engineers. After half an hour, 1/2 of the total number of people left. How many engineers are left if 31 doctors stayed at the party?", "answer": "There were a total of 55 doctors + 75 engineers = <<55+75=130>>130 people who attended the party.\nAfter half an hour, 130 people * 1/2 = <<130*1/2=65>>65 people left the party.\nThis means 130 people - 65 people = <<130-65=65>>65 people stayed.\nOut of the 65 who stayed, 65 people - 31 doctors = <<65-31=34>>34 were engineers.\n#### 34", "id_orig": 320, "id_shuffled": 82}
