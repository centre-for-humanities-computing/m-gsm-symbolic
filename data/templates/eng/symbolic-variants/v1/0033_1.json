{"question": "Sophia and Amanda are sisters from Philadelphia who love collecting signatures from athletes. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 5 weeks, Sophia and Amanda compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Sophia has 36 signatures in her book, and Amanda has 46. The sisters have 5 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Sophia and Amanda have already collected 36 + 46 signatures = <<36+46=82>>82 signatures.\nSince their goal is 145, they need to collect 145 - 82 signatures. 145 - 82 = <<145-82=63>>63 signatures\n#### 63", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
