{"question": "At Chris's house, there are five times as many bananas as pears. He has a total of 93 pears in his house. Chris bought 70 more pears at the store and 23 fewer bananas than the number of pears. Find the combined total of the number of bananas and pears Chris has in the house?", "answer": "Before buying any banana and pear, Chris had five times as many bananas as pears, which is 93 pears*5 banana/pear = <<93*5=465>>465 bananas\nThe total number of bananas and pears that Chris had before is 465 bananas + 93 pears = <<465+93=558>>558 items\nWhen he bought 23 fewer bananas than pears, he bought 70 bananas - 23 bananas = <<70-23=47>>47 bananas\nIn total, he bought 47 bananas + 70 pears = <<47+70=117>>117 items\nAfter the purchases, Chris has 558 items + 117 items = <<558+117=675>>675 total bananas and pears combined.\n#### 675", "id_orig": 406, "id_shuffled": 91}
