{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of apples, hay, carrots and wheats. Since wheats are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-ounce boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-ounce bags. Apples are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty-four 70-ounce packs. Hay are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys eighteen 65-ounce sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1800 ounces at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 ounces of wheats.\nHe is buying 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 ounces of carrots.\nHe is buying 18*65 = <<18*65=1170>>1170 ounces of hay.\nHe is buying 34*70 = <<34*70=2380>>2380 ounces of apples.\nThe weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 1170 + 2380 = <<2+48+1170+2380=3600>>3600 ounces.\nThus, the farmer needs 3600 / 1800 = <<3600/1800=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
