{"question": "Chris collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. The first two have 150 apartments each and the last one is 25% bigger than the other two combined. He collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.2 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first two complexes have 2*150=<<2*150=300>>300 apartments\nNumber 3 has 300*0.25=<<300*0.25=75>>75 more apartments than those two combined.\nSo in total, it has 300+75=<<300+75=375>>375 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 375+300=<<375+300=675>>675 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 675*5=<<675*5=3375>>3375 apartments every week\nSo he makes 3375*€0.2=€<<3375*0.2=675>>675 every week\n#### 675", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
