On Wednesday, he sold 14 more boxes of gingerbread than on Tuesday and 26 boxes of pear pie. If the gingerbread cost $9 and the pear pie cost $28, how much did David earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 30 + 14 = <<30+14=44>>44 boxes of gingerbread on Wednesday.\nThe total number of boxes of gingerbread that David sold is 30 + 44 = <<30+44=74>>74.\nDavid earned 74*$9 = $<<74*9=666>>666 for selling gingerbread.\nHe sold 26 - 4 = <<26-4=22>>22 boxes of pear pie on Tuesday.\nThe total number of boxes of pear pie that David sold is 26 + 22 = <<26+22=48>>48.\nHe earned 48*$28 = $<<48*28=1344>>1344 for selling pear pie.\nSo, David earned $666 + $1344 = $<<666+1344=2010>>2010 for two days.\n#### 2010", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
