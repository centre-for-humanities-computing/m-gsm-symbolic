{"question": "In a set of artist's cards, there are 58 red cards, and 20% more yellow cards. Green cards are as many as the sum of red and yellow cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 20/100 * 58 = <<20/100*58=11>>11 more yellow cards than red cards.\nWhich means there are 58 + 11 = <<58+11=69>>69 yellow cards.\nGreen cards make up to 58 + 69 = <<58+69=127>>127 cards.\nSo in total, there are 127 + 127 = <<127+127=254>>254 cards of different colors.\n#### 254", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
