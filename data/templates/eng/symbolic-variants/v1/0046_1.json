{"question": "Oakwood High School is holding graduation in their Convention Center this year which has space for 4400 people. After accounting for 250 seats for graduates and 450 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?", "answer": "Add graduate and faculty seats together. 250 + 450 = <<250+450=700>>700 seats for faculty and graduates\nMinus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 4400 - 700 = <<4400-700=3700>>3700 remaining seats.\nDivide remaining seats by the number of graduates. 3700/250 = <<3700/250=14>>14 tickets\n#### 14", "id_orig": 1031, "id_shuffled": 46}
