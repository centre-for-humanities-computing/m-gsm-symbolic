{"question": "A hospital has a capacity of 1800 beds with 1/12 occupied. Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/12 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/12 * 1800 = <<1800*1/12=150>>150 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1800 beds - 150 beds = <<1800-150=1650>>1650 beds.\nIf 20 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 20 patients/day * 7 days/week = 140 patients.\nAfter 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 140 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<140*2=280>>280 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 1650 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1650 beds - 280 beds = <<1650-280=1370>>1370 unoccupied beds.\n#### 1370", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
