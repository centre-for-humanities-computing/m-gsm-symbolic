{"question": "Abby's dad said that she had €170 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have €4 in game room tokens, and get to ride the bumper cars twice. A round of mini-golf is €10. The bumper cars cost €10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The bumper cars will cost €20 per person because 10*2 = <<10*2=20>>20\nEach person costs €34 because 4 + 10 + 20 = <<4+10+20=34>>34\n5 total people can attend because 170 / 34 = <<170/34=5>>5\nShe can invite 4 friends because 5 - 1 =<<5-1=4>>4\n#### 4", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
