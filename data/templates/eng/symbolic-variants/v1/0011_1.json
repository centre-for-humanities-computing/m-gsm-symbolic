{"question": "Kenneth wants to make different sized ice cubes with 124 pounds of water. He can make giant cubes that use 6 pounds per cube, medium cubes that use 4 pounds, and small cubes that use 1/8 pound. If he makes 4 giant cubes, 10 medium cubes, and 24 small cubes, how many pounds of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 24 pounds of water because 4 times 6 equals <<4*6=24>>24.\nThe medium cubes used up 40 pounds of water because 10 times 4 equals <<10*4=40>>40.\nThe small cubes used up 3 pounds of water because 24 times 1/8 equals 3.\nThis means that Kenneth has used up 67 pounds of water because 24 plus 40 plus 3 equals 67.\nKenneth has 57 pounds of water left because 124 minus 67 equals <<124-67=57>>57.\n#### 57", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
