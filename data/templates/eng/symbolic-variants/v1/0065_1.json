{"question": "Andrea is trying to decide whether to do her financial planning herself or hire one financial advisor. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 13 fewer hours of part-time work, losing $88/hour in missed income. The financial advisor charges $184. How much more money will she have if she hires the financial advisor?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Andrea does her financial planning herself: $88/hour * 13 hours = $<<88*13=1144>>1144\nThen subtract the financial advisor's charge to find how much money Andrea saves: $1144 - $184 = $<<1144-184=960>>960\n#### 960", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
