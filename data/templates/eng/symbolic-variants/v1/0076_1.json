{"question": "Bob caught 4 trouts last Wednesday, the first trout he caught weighs 54 pounds, the second trout he caught weighs 53 pounds, and the remaining trout he caught weighs 35 pounds. If a pound of trout costs $1.5, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?", "answer": "Bob will earn 54*$1.5 = $<<54*1.5=81>>81 from the first trout.\nHe will earn 53*$1.5 = $<<53*1.5=79.5>>79.5 for the second trout.\nThe rest of the trouts are 4-2 = <<4-2=2>>2. He will earn 35*$1.5 = $<<35*1.5=52.5>>52.5 per each of them. So he will earn 2 * 52.5 = <<2*52.5>>=105\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is $81 + $79.5 + $105= $<<81+79.5+105=265>>265.\n#### 265", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
