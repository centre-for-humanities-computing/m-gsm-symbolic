{"question": "I have 9 liters of mango drink that are half water and I wish to add it to 20 liters of lemon drink that is one fifth water. But as I pour it, I spill three liters of the mango drink. How much water is in the remaining 26 liters?", "answer": "There are 20*1/5 = <<20*1/5=4>>4 liters of water from the 20 liters lemon drink.\nAfter three liters of mango drink was spilled, there were 9-3 = <<9-3=6>>6 liters of mango drink left.\nOut of the 6 liters, 6*1/2 = <<6*1/2=3>>3 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 liters of water out of the 26 liters.\n#### 7", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
