{"question": "In a set of scientist's cards, there are 22 blue cards, and 21% more yellow cards. Orange cards are as many as the sum of blue and yellow cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 21/100 * 22 = <<21/100*22=4>>4 more yellow cards than blue cards.\nWhich means there are 22 + 4 = <<22+4=26>>26 yellow cards.\nOrange cards make up to 22 + 26 = <<22+26=48>>48 cards.\nSo in total, there are 48 + 48 = <<48+48=96>>96 cards of different colors.\n#### 96", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
