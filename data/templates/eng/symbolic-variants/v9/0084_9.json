{"question": "Laura buys 14 shares of a stock for £59 each. The stock price increases 75% the first year Laura holds it, then decreases 30% in the second year. What is the final value of all Laura's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Laura's purchase: 14 shares * £59/share = £<<14*59=826>>826\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: £826 * 0.75 = £<<826*0.75=619.5>>619\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: £826 + £619.5 = £<<826+619.5=1445.5>>1445\nThen multiply that amount by 30% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: £1445.5 * 30% = £<<1445.5*30*.01=433.65>>433\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: £1445 - £433 = £<<1445-433=1011>>1011\n#### 1011", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
