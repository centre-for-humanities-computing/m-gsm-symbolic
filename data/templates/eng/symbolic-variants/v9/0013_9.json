{"question": "Laura is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 30 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 7 potted plants on each of the 58 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 2 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Laura remain with?", "answer": "Two days ago, before receiving the plants, Laura had 7*58 = <<7*58=406>>406 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 30 plants, she therefore had a total of 406 + 30 = <<406+30=436>>436 potted plants\nTomorrow, Lauras plant giveaway will be 58*2 = <<58*2=116>>116 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 436 - 116 = <<436-116=320>>320 potted plants.\n#### 320", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
