{"question": "Eric watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched a 2-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 60-minute show. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 5-hour episodes. If he watched 26 hours of TV in all, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Thursday.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 26 - 2 = <<26-2=24>>24 hours of TV left.\nAfter Wednesday, he had 24 - 2 = <<24-2=22>>22 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 22 - 4 - 0.75 = 17.25 hours of TV left.\nAfter Saturday, he had 17.25 - 15 = 2.25 hours of TV left.\nEach 60-minute episode is 1 hour.\nThus, E = 2.25/1 = 2.25 episodes.\n#### 2.25", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
