{"question": "Matt collects garbage from 5 different apartment complexes. The first four have 250 apartments each and the last one is 60% bigger than the other four combined. He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid £0.55 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first four complexes have 4*250=<<4*250=1000>>1000 apartments\nNumber 5 has 1000*0.6=<<1000*0.6=600>>600 more apartments than those four combined.\nSo in total, it has 1000+600=<<1000+600=1600>>1600 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 1600+1000=<<1600+1000=2600>>2600 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 2600*3=<<2600*3=7800>>7800 apartments every week\nSo he makes 7800*£0.55=£<<7800*0.55=4290>>4290 every week\n#### 4290", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
