{"question": "Ella is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 20 pop in the first 12 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 12 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next 12 seconds, but in the final 12 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 12 seconds. After Ella takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 12 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Ella have to eat?", "answer": "In the second 12 seconds of cooking, 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.\nIn the third 12 seconds, 4*20=<<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.\nIn the final 12 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.\nAfter cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.\nThus, Ella has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = <<20+60+80+40+10=210>>210 pieces of popcorn to eat.\n#### 210", "id_orig": 1264, "id_shuffled": 4}
