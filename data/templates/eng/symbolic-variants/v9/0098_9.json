{"question": "A virus infects seventeen people. Every day, each infected person infects seven others. How many people are infected after three days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original seventeen people infect seven people each, so 17*7 = <<17*7=119>>119 more people are infected.\nThere are 17+119 = <<17+119=136>>136 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 136*7 = <<136*7=952>>952 more people are infected.\nThere are 136 + 952 = <<136+952=1088>>1088 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 1088*7 = 7616 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 1088 + 7616 = 8704 infected people after three days.\n#### 8704", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
