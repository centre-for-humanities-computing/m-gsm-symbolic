{"question": "Ellen is knitting winter wear for her 2 grandchildren. They're twins, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a poncho, beanie, sweater, gloves, and socks for each of them. It takes 11 skeins of wool to make a poncho, 10 for a beanie, 17 for a sweater, 8 for a pair of gloves, and 18 for a pair of socks. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 11 skeins per poncho + 10 skeins per beanie + 17 skeins per sweater + 8 skeins per pair of gloves + 18 skeins per pair of socks = <<11+10+17+8+18=64>>64 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 2*64 = <<2*64=128>>128 skeins of wool.\n#### 128", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
