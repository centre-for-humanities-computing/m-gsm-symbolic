{"question": "Lucas goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs $3 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 30% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 2 kilogram of rice per day. He also decided to buy himself a cookie for $3. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The rice he bought was 3*0.3=$<<3*0.3=0>>0 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 3+0=$<<3+0=3>>3 per kilogram\nHe goes through 2*7=<<2*7=14>>14 kilograms of rice a week\nSo he paid 3.9*14=$<<3.9*14=54>>54 on rice\nThat means his total bill was 54+3=$<<54+3=57>>57\n#### 57", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
