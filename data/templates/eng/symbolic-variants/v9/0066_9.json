{"question": "Kenneth has 50 light red spools of thread, 60 dark red spools of thread, 45 light green spools of thread, and 65 dark green spools of thread. What percent of her spools are red?", "answer": "First find the number of red spools: 50 spools + 60 spools = <<50+60=110>>110 spools\nThen find the total number of spools: 45 spools + 65 spools + 110 spools = <<45+65+110=220>>220 spools\nThen divide the number of red spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 110 spools / 220 spools * 100% = 50%\n#### 50", "id_orig": 728, "id_shuffled": 66}
