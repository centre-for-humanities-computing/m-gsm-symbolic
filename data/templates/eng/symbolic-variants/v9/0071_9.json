{"question": "Bob is feeding his livestock silage. Each goat needs 6 kilograms, and each duck needs 3 kilograms less than twice the amount each goat needs. If there are 43 goats and 50 ducks, how many kilograms of silage does Bob need?", "answer": "First figure out how much silage each duck needs: 6 kilograms * 2 - 3 = <<6*2-3=9>>9 kilograms/duck\nNow figure out how much silage total the ducks need: 9 kilograms/duck * 50 ducks = <<9*50=450>>450 kilograms\nNow figure out how much silage total the goats need: 6 kilograms/goat * 43 goats = <<6*43=258>>258 kilograms\nNow add the two amounts of silage to find the total: 450 kilograms + 258 kilograms = <<450+258=708>>708 kilograms\n#### 708", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
