{"question": "Mr. Jones sold his cottage for $990,000. He paid the registration fees that amount to 1% of the selling price and also paid a agent fee that is 3% of the selling price. If he also paid $280,000 for the remaining loan amount of the cottage, how much is Mr. Jones's net proceeds from selling the cottage?", "answer": "Mr. Jones paid $990,000*1/100 = $9900 for the registration fees.\nHe paid $990,000*3/100 = $29,700 for the agent fee.\nSo, Mr. Jones paid a total of $9900 + $29,700 + $280,000 = $319,600 for the registration, agent, and loan fees.\nHence, Mr. Jones's net proceeds is $990,000 - $319,600 = $670,400.\n#### 670,400", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
