{"question": "Jessica's uncle said that she had $280 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of laser tag, have $8 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster four times. A round of laser tag is $4. The roller coaster cost $7 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The roller coaster will cost $28 per person because 7*4 = <<7*4=28>>28\nEach person costs $40 because 8 + 4 + 28 = <<8+4+28=40>>40\n7 total people can attend because 280 / 40 = <<280/40=7>>7\nShe can invite 6 friends because 7 - 1 =<<7-1=6>>6\n#### 6", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
