{"question": "Michael went to buy some school supplies. He bought 24 rulers which cost $7.75 each, 6 pencils which cost $7.5 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost $16. How much did Michael spend on everything?", "answer": "Michael spent 24*$7.75 = $<<24*7.75=186>>186 for the rulers.\nHe also spent 6*$7.5 = $<<6*7.5=45>>45 for the pencils.\nTherefore, Michael spent a total of $186 + $45 + $16 = $<<186+45+16=247>>247 for the school supplies.\n#### 247", "id_orig": 158, "id_shuffled": 18}
