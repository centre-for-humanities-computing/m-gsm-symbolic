{"question": "A medical center has a capacity of 1800 rooms with 1/6 occupied. Due to the major accident, 40 patients are admitted into the medical center each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the medical center after 3 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/6 of the total capacity of the medical center rooms is occupied, it means 1/6 * 1800 = <<1800*1/6=300>>300 rooms have patients using them.\nThe total number of rooms in the medical center without new admissions is 1800 rooms - 300 rooms = <<1800-300=1500>>1500 rooms.\nIf 40 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the medical center after one week is 40 patients/day * 7 days/week = 280 patients.\nAfter 3 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the medical center is 280 patients/week * 3 weeks = <<280*3=840>>840 patients, who each use one room.\nIf there were 1500 unoccupied rooms in the medical center before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1500 rooms - 840 rooms = <<1500-840=660>>660 unoccupied rooms.\n#### 660", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
