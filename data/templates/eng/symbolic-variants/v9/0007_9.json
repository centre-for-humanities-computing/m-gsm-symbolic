{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of hay, wheats, beets and apples. Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys four 2-lb boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 12-lb bags. Hay are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty-two 60-lb packs. Wheats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1650 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 lbs of apples.\nHe is buying 6*12 = <<6*12=72>>72 lbs of beets.\nHe is buying 20*65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 lbs of wheats.\nHe is buying 32*60 = <<32*60=1920>>1920 lbs of hay.\nThe weight of all the feed is 8 + 72 + 1300 + 1920 = <<8+72+1300+1920=3300>>3300 lbs.\nThus, the farmer needs 3300 / 1650 = <<3300/1650=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
