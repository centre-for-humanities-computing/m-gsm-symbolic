{"question": "In Dr. Lee's class of 118 students, 20% of the class are basketball players. Out of the remaining class, 39% of the students are debate team members or part of robotics club members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "20% of the 118 student class are basketball players so that's 0.2*118 = <<0.2*118=23>>23 students\nThere are 118 students and 23 are basketball players so that leaves 118-23 = <<118-23=95>>95 students\n39% of the remaining 95 students are part of robotics club members or debate team members so that's 0.39*95 = <<0.39*95=37>>37 students\n23 students are basketball players and 37 are part of robotics club members/debate team members so 23+37 = <<23+37=60>>60 students will be leaving early\n#### 60", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
