{"question": "Sophia is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the hiragana (with 48 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full thrice, writes one quarter of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Sophia written in total?", "answer": "Sophia has written the hiragana (with 48 letters) thrice which is a total of 48*3=<<48*3=144>>144 letters.\nShe then writes one quarter the hiragana (with 48 letters), which is 48*1/4=<<48*1/4=12>>12 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 144 + 12 = <<144+12=156>>156 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 156 * 2 = <<156*2=312>>312 letters.\n#### 312", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
