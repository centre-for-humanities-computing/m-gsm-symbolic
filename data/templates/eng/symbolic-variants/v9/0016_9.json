{"question": "Eric is selling cookies and orange pie for a fundraiser. On Friday, he sold 26 boxes of cookies and 5 fewer boxes of orange pie, than on Saturday. On Saturday, he sold 13 more boxes of cookies than on Friday and 16 boxes of orange pie. If the cookies cost $9 and the orange pie cost $23, how much did Eric earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 26 + 13 = <<26+13=39>>39 boxes of cookies on Saturday.\nThe total number of boxes of cookies that Eric sold is 26 + 39 = <<26+39=65>>65.\nEric earned 65*$9 = $<<65*9=585>>585 for selling cookies.\nHe sold 16 - 5 = <<16-5=11>>11 boxes of orange pie on Friday.\nThe total number of boxes of orange pie that Eric sold is 16 + 11 = <<16+11=27>>27.\nHe earned 27*$23 = $<<27*23=621>>621 for selling orange pie.\nSo, Eric earned $585 + $621 = $<<585+621=1206>>1206 for two days.\n#### 1206", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
