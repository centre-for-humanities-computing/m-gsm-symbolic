{"question": "Emma is trying to decide whether to do her financial planning herself or hire one financial advisor. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 6 fewer hours of part-time work, losing £64/hour in missed income. The financial advisor charges £150. How much more money will she have if she hires the financial advisor?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Emma does her financial planning herself: £64/hour * 6 hours = £<<64*6=384>>384\nThen subtract the financial advisor's charge to find how much money Emma saves: £384 - £150 = £<<384-150=234>>234\n#### 234", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
