{"question": "A maintenance worker has to clean a university with 60 rooms. They have 4 days to get it done. It takes them 15 minutes per room. If they work 8 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?", "answer": "They have to clean 15 rooms a day because 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15\nThey spend 225 minutes cleaning per day because 15*15 = <<15*15=225>>225\nThey spend 3.75 hours a day because 225 / 60 = <<225/60=3.75>>3.75\nThey spend 15/32 of their day cleaning rooms because 3.75 / 8 = <<3.75/8=0.46875>>0.46875\nThey spend 46% of their day cleaning rooms because 0.46875*100 = <<0.46875*100=46>>46\n#### 46", "id_orig": 1239, "id_shuffled": 39}
