{"question": "Joshua caught 7 trouts last Sunday, the first trout he caught weighs 41 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 42 kilograms, and the remaining trout he caught weighs 23 kilograms. If a kilogram of trout costs £0.5, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?", "answer": "Joshua will earn 41*£0.5 = £<<41*0.5=20.5>>20.5 from the first trout.\nHe will earn 42*£0.5 = £<<42*0.5=21>>21 for the second trout.\nThe rest of the trouts are 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5. He will earn 23*£0.5 = £<<23*0.5=11.5>>11.5 per each of them. So he will earn 5 * 11.5 = <<5*11.5>>=57.5\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is £20.5 + £21 + £57.5= £<<20.5+21+57.5=98>>99.\n#### 99", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
