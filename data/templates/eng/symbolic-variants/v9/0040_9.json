{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $32 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $3 per pound, get 1 pound 1/3 off.\" She scooped up 4 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $2.5 and 10 magnets that were $1.0 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound 1/3 off. So 1/3 off of 1 pound is $3*1/3 = $1. The rest of 2 pound does not have discount and costs 2*$3 = $6, so total is $3+$2+$6=$11\n10 magnets at $1 each is 10*1=$<<10*1=10>>10\nWhen you add all her purchases, 11+$2.5+$10 = $<<11+2.5+10=23>>23\nShe had $32 and spent $23 so she had $32-$23 = $<<32-23=9>>9 left over\n#### 9", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
