{"question": "Dr. Patel is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $300,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $290,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 7% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 10% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Dr. Patel's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $290,000*7/100 = $<<290,000*7/100=20,300>>20,300.\nThe transfer fee is $290,000*10/100 = $<<290,000*10/100=29,000>>29,000.\nThe total price of the house is $290,000 + $20,300 + $29,000 = $339,300.\nSo, it is $339,300 - $300,000 = $<<339,300-300,000=39,300>>39,300 more than Dr. Patel's budget.\n#### 39,300", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
