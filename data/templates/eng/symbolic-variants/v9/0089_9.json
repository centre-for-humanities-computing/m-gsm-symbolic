{"question": "Ethan hires a boat from 2 PM to 7 PM. He gets 2 hour(s) free. The first paid hour is £25 and each hour after that is twice the cost. How much did he pay?", "answer": "He got it for 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 hours\nHe pays for 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 hours\nThe first hour cost 1*25=£<<1*25=25>>25\nThe other 3-1=2 hours are more expensive\nThey cost 25*2=£<<25*2=50>>50 per hour\nSo those 2 hours cost 2*50=£<<2*50=100>>100\nSo he pays 100+25=£<<100+25=125>>125 in total\n#### 125", "id_orig": 652, "id_shuffled": 89}
