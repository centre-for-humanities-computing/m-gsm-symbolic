{"question": "If David and Michael have 940 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Michael getting 160 yards more than David, how much is left over for David?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence David gets and y be the amount Michael gets. We know that y = x + 160, and y + x = 940.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+160=940\nSubtracting the 160 from both sides, we get 2x=780\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=390. This means David has 390 yards of fence left over.\n#### 390", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
