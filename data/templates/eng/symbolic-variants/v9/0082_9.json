{"question": "At the beginning of the gathering, there were 50 lawyers and 58 engineers. After 45 minutes, 1/6 of the total number of people left. How many engineers are left if 19 lawyers stayed at the gathering?", "answer": "There were a total of 50 lawyers + 58 engineers = <<50+58=108>>108 people who attended the gathering.\nAfter 45 minutes, 108 people * 1/6 = <<108*1/6=18>>18 people left the gathering.\nThis means 108 people - 18 people = <<108-18=90>>90 people stayed.\nOut of the 90 who stayed, 90 people - 19 lawyers = <<90-19=71>>71 were engineers.\n#### 71", "id_orig": 320, "id_shuffled": 82}
