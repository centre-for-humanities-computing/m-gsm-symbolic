{"question": "Oliver's car breaks down. The car weighs 1750 pounds and he has equipment in it weighing 100 pounds. He also has his two young colleagues who weigh 85 pounds each in it. If the force to move the car is 3% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the car?", "answer": "His two colleagues weigh 85*2=<<85*2=170>>170 pounds\nSo the total weight of the car and everything is 1750+100+170=<<1750+100+170=2020>>2020 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 2020*0.03=<<2020*0.03=60>>60 pounds\n#### 60", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
