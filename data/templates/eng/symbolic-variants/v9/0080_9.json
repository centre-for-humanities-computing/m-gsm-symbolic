{"question": "The vending machines sell crackers for 35 cents and pretzels for 105 cents. Chris spent $10 and got 2 bags of crackers and had 9% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?", "answer": "Chris got $0.9 in change because $10*9/100 = <<10*9/100=0.9>>0.9\nChris spent $9.1 because 10 - 0.9 = <<10-0.9=9.1>>9.1\nChris spent $0.7 on crackers because 2*0.35 = <<2*0.35=0.7>>0.7\nChris spent 8.4 on pretzels because 9.1 - 0.7 = <<9.1-0.7=8.4>>8.4\nChris bought 8 pretzels because 8.4 / 1.05 = <<8=8>>8\n#### 8", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
