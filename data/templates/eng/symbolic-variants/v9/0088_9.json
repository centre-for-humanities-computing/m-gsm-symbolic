{"question": "Anna can run five times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is three fifths as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in eight hours if she spends one quarter of the time running and three quarters of the time walking?", "answer": "If Anna can skip at three fifths the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*5/3=<<3*5/3=5>>5 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is five times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 5/5=1 miles per hour.\nIf three quarters of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 8*3/4=<<8*3/4=6>>6 hours.\nIf one quarter of the time is spent running, then she runs for 8-6=<<8-6=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 5 miles per hour, or 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 miles.\nShe walks for 6 hours at 1 miles per hour, or 6*1=<<6*1=6>>6 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 10+6=<<10+6=16>>16 miles.\n#### 16", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
