How many like to bake if the number that like to hike is twice the number that prefer playing basketball?", "answer": "The number of students that like to hike is twice as many as the number who like basketball, so 2 * 11 = <<2*11=22>>22\nThe number that like to bake is 111 total students - 34 that like to read - 11 that like to play basketball - 22 that like to hike = <<111-34-11-22=44>>44\n#### 44", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
