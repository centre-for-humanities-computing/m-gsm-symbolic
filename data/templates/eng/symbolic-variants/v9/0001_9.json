{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 253 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city. If the city is 52 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 52/4 = <<52/4=13>>13 intervals of 253 minutes.\nThus, it will take 13 * 253 = <<13*253=3289>>3289 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 3289", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
