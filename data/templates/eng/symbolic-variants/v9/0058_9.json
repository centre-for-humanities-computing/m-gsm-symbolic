{"question": "One troll can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with basic shovel. He can mine twice as much with a silver pickaxe and 50% more with a bronze pickaxe than with a silver pickaxe. How many kgs of ore can 20 trolls with bronze pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a troll can mine with an silver pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 kgs/day\nThen multiply that amount by 150% to find how much a troll can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 kgs/day * 150% = <<10*150*.01=15>>15 kgs/day\nThen multiply the amount one troll can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of trolls: 15 kgs/day/troll * 20 trolls = <<15*20=300>>300 kgs/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 300 kgs/day * 28 days = <<300*28=8400>>8400 kgs/day\n#### 8400", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
