{"question": "Michael has a bag of beads with 92 inside. He tripped over a root while carrying it and dropped one quarter of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 17. When he went back home, he inspected the beads further. Seven of the ones he picked up weren't beads, but actually pebbles so he got rid of them. How many beads did Michael end up with?", "answer": "Michael dropped his beads and was left with 92*3/4=<<92*3/4=69>>69 beads.\nHe searched and found some of his lost beads, getting him back to 69+17=<<69+17=86>>86 beads.\nHe went home and removed seven pebbles, leaving him with 86-7=<<86-7=79>>79 beads.\n#### 79", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
