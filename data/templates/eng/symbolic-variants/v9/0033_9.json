{"question": "Emma and Claire are sisters from Dallas who love collecting signatures from athletes. During their winter break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 8 weeks, Emma and Claire compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Emma has 22 signatures in her book, and Claire has 33. The sisters have 4 more weeks of winter break, and they decide they want to reach 95 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Emma and Claire have already collected 22 + 33 signatures = <<22+33=55>>55 signatures.\nSince their goal is 95, they need to collect 95 - 55 signatures. 95 - 55 = <<95-55=40>>40 signatures\n#### 40", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
