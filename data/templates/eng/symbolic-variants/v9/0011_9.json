{"question": "Alex wants to make different sized ice cubes with 212 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 9 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 3 ounces, and small cubes that use 1/2 ounce. If he makes 5 giant cubes, 8 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many ounces of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 45 ounces of water because 5 times 9 equals <<5*9=45>>45.\nThe medium cubes used up 24 ounces of water because 8 times 3 equals <<8*3=24>>24.\nThe small cubes used up 4 ounces of water because 8 times 1/2 equals 4.\nThis means that Alex has used up 73 ounces of water because 45 plus 24 plus 4 equals 73.\nAlex has 139 ounces of water left because 212 minus 73 equals <<212-73=139>>139.\n#### 139", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
