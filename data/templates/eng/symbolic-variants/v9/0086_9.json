{"question": "Maya qualified for a spot on the swimming team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a jersey for €17, a pair of swimming shorts for €5 more than the jersey cost, and a pair of sneakers that were originally €72 but were on sale for two thirds price. She had a coupon for €2 off the package of €13 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The shorts were €5 more than the jersey, so they cost €5 + €17 = €<<5+17=22>>22.\nHer sneakers were two thirds the original €72 price, so they cost €72*2/3=€48.\nWith her coupon, the socks were €13 - €2 = €<<13-2=11>>11.\nThe jersey, shorts, sneakers, and socks together cost €17 + €22 + €48 + €11 = €<<17+22+48+11=98>>98.\n#### 98", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
