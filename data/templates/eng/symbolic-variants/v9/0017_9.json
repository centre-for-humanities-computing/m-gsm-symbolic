{"question": "Isabella walks 19 fts every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 12 fts of walking on the beach and 7 ft(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Isabella walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 19-ft walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Isabella walks at a rate of 12 fts per 60 minutes, or 12/60 = 1/5 fts per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/5 = 0.4 fts per minute.\nTo walk 7 ft(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 7/0.4 = <<7/0.4=17.5>>17.5 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Isabella 60+17.5 = <<60+17.5=77.5>>77.5 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 77.5", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
