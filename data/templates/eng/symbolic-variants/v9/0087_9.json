{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Water Wonderland is 400 meters long, and people slide down at 40 meters/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 210 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 60 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 400 meters / 40 meters/minute = <<400/40=10>>10 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 210 meters / 60 meters/minute = <<210/60=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 10 minutes - 3 minutes = <<10-3=7>>7 minutes\n#### 7", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
