{"question": "To make a call from a phone booth, you must pay £0.25 for each minute of your call. After 11 minutes, that price drops to £0.2 per minute. How much would a 85-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 11 minutes would be a cost of 11 * 0.25 = £<<11*0.25=2>>2.\nAfter that, there are 85 - 11 = <<85-11=74>>74 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 74 minutes cost 74 * 0.2 = £<<74*0.2=14>>14.\nSo in total, the 85-minute call would cost 2 + 14 = £16.\n#### 17", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
