{"question": "Sophie can peel 5 onions a minute and saute 20 onions in 11 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 80 onions?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Sophie to peel the onions: 80 onions / 5 onions/minute = <<80/5=16>>16 minutes\nThen find how many batches of onions she needs to cook: 80 onions / 20 onions/batch = <<80/20=4>>4 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 4 batches * 11 minutes/batch = <<4*11=44>>44 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Sophie spends: 44 minutes + 16 minutes = <<44+16=60>>60 minutes\n#### 60", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
