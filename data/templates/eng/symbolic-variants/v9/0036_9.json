How much was the total cost?", "answer": "The total charge for the croissants was 3*$16 = $<<3*16=48>>48.\nThe total charge for the tarts was 10*$77 = $<<10*77=770>>770.\nThe total charge for the scones was 5*$112 = $<<5*112=560>>560.\nTherefore the total amount Lily paid for the pastries was $48 + $770 + $560 = $<<48+770+560=1378>>1378.\n#### 1378", "id_orig": 11, "id_shuffled": 36}
