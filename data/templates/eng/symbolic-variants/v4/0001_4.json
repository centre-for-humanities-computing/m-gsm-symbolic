{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 177 minutes to cover every 80 miles of the city. If the city is 56 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 56/80 = <<56/80=0>>0 intervals of 177 minutes.\nThus, it will take 0 * 177 = <<0*177=0>>0 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 0", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
