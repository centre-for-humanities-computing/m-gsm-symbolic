{"question": "Isabella's mom said that she had €280 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of bowling, have €5 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the go-karts four times. A round of bowling is €9. The go-karts cost €14 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The go-karts will cost €56 per person because 14*4 = <<14*4=56>>56\nEach person costs €70 because 5 + 9 + 56 = <<5+9+56=70>>70\n4 total people can attend because 280 / 70 = <<280/70=4>>4\nShe can invite 3 friends because 4 - 1 =<<4-1=3>>3\n#### 3", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
