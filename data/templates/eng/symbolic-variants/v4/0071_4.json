{"question": "Bob is feeding his livestock silage. Each horse needs 11 kg, and each pig needs 3 kg less than twice the amount each horse needs. If there are 33 horses and 25 pigs, how many kg of silage does Bob need?", "answer": "First figure out how much silage each pig needs: 11 kg * 2 - 3 = <<11*2-3=19>>19 kg/pig\nNow figure out how much silage total the pigs need: 19 kg/pig * 25 pigs = <<19*25=475>>475 kg\nNow figure out how much silage total the horses need: 11 kg/horse * 33 horses = <<11*33=363>>363 kg\nNow add the two amounts of silage to find the total: 475 kg + 363 kg = <<475+363=838>>838 kg\n#### 838", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
