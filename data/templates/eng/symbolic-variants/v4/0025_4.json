{"question": "In Ms. Johnson's class of 60 students, 11% of the class are swimmers. Out of the remaining class, 33% of the students are choir members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away meet. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "11% of the 60 student class are swimmers so that's 0.11*60 = <<0.11*60=6>>6 students\nThere are 60 students and 6 are swimmers so that leaves 60-6 = <<60-6=54>>54 students\n33% of the remaining 54 students are part of dancers or choir members so that's 0.33*54 = <<0.33*54=17>>17 students\n6 students are swimmers and 17 are part of dancers/choir members so 6+17 = <<6+17=24>>24 students will be leaving early\n#### 24", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
