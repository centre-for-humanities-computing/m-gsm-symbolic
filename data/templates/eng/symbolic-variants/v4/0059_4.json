{"question": "I have 20 liters of mango drink that are half water and I wish to add it to 16 liters of lemon drink that is three quarters water. But as I pour it, I spill four liters of the mango drink. How much water is in the remaining 32 liters?", "answer": "There are 16*3/4 = <<16*3/4=12>>12 liters of water from the 16 liters lemon drink.\nAfter four liters of mango drink was spilled, there were 20-4 = <<20-4=16>>16 liters of mango drink left.\nOut of the 16 liters, 16*1/2 = <<16*1/2=8>>8 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 12 + 8 = <<12+8=20>>20 liters of water out of the 32 liters.\n#### 20", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
