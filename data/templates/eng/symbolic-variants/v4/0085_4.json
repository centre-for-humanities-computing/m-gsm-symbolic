{"question": "If Madison and Jason have 960 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Jason getting 80 feet more than Madison, how much is left over for Madison?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Madison gets and y be the amount Jason gets. We know that y = x + 80, and y + x = 960.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+80=960\nSubtracting the 80 from both sides, we get 2x=880\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=440. This means Madison has 440 feet of fence left over.\n#### 440", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
