{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $25 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $1 per pound, get 1 pound 1/12 off.\" She scooped up 4 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.0 and 4 magnets that were $0.75 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $1 and gets 1 pound 1/12 off. So 1/12 off of 1 pound is $1*1/12 = $0.08333333333333333. The rest of 2 pound does not have discount and costs 2*$1 = $2, so total is $1+$11/12+$2=$47/12\n4 magnets at $0.75 each is 4*0.75=$<<4*0.75=3>>3\nWhen you add all her purchases, 47/12+$1+$3 = $<<47/12+1+3=7>>7\nShe had $25 and spent $7 so she had $25-$7 = $<<25-7=18>>18 left over\n#### 18", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
