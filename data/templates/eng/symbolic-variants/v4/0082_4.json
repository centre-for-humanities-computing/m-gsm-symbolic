{"question": "At the beginning of the party, there were 67 engineers and 44 nurses. After an hour, 1/3 of the total number of people left. How many nurses are left if 27 engineers stayed at the party?", "answer": "There were a total of 67 engineers + 44 nurses = <<67+44=111>>111 people who attended the party.\nAfter an hour, 111 people * 1/3 = <<111*1/3=37>>37 people left the party.\nThis means 111 people - 37 people = <<111-37=74>>74 people stayed.\nOut of the 74 who stayed, 74 people - 27 engineers = <<74-27=47>>47 were nurses.\n#### 47", "id_orig": 320, "id_shuffled": 82}
