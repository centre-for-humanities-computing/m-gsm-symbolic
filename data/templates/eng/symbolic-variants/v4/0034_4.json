{"question": "Dr. Davis sold his cottage for $630,000. He paid the transfer fees that amount to 2% of the selling price and also paid a agent fee that is 4% of the selling price. If he also paid $500,000 for the remaining loan amount of the cottage, how much is Dr. Davis's net proceeds from selling the cottage?", "answer": "Dr. Davis paid $630,000*2/100 = $12,600 for the transfer fees.\nHe paid $630,000*4/100 = $25,200 for the agent fee.\nSo, Dr. Davis paid a total of $12,600 + $25,200 + $500,000 = $537,800 for the transfer, agent, and loan fees.\nHence, Dr. Davis's net proceeds is $630,000 - $537,800 = $92,200.\n#### 92,200", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
