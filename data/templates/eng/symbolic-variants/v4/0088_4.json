{"question": "Sophia can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends one quarter of the time running and three quarters of the time walking?", "answer": "If Sophia can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 12/2=6 miles per hour.\nIf three quarters of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 4*3/4=<<4*3/4=3>>3 hours.\nIf one quarter of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-3=<<4-3=1>>1 hours.\nThus, she runs for 1 hours at 12 miles per hour, or 1*12=<<1*12=12>>12 miles.\nShe walks for 3 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 3*6=<<3*6=18>>18 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 12+18=<<12+18=30>>30 miles.\n#### 30", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
