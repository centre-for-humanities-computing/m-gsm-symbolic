{"question": "A virus infects eighteen people. Every day, each infected person infects three others. How many people are infected after three days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original eighteen people infect three people each, so 18*3 = <<18*3=54>>54 more people are infected.\nThere are 18+54 = <<18+54=72>>72 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 72*3 = <<72*3=216>>216 more people are infected.\nThere are 72 + 216 = <<72+216=288>>288 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 288*3 = 864 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 288 + 864 = 1152 infected people after three days.\n#### 1152", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
