{"question": "Jessica saw a 180-foot dolphin with 8 54-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 54 inches/remora * 8 remoras = <<54*8=432>>432 inches.\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 432 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<432/12=36>>36 foot.\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 36 foot / 180 feet * 100% = 20%\n\n#### 20", "id_orig": 473, "id_shuffled": 0}
