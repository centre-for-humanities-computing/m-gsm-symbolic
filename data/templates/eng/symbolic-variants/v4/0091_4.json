{"question": "At Joe's house, there are twice as many bananas as grapes. He has a total of 93 grapes in his house. Joe bought 83 more grapes at the store and 45 fewer bananas than the number of grapes. Find the combined total of the number of bananas and grapes Joe has in the house?", "answer": "Before buying any banana and grape, Joe had twice as many bananas as grapes, which is 93 grapes*2 banana/grape = <<93*2=186>>186 bananas\nThe total number of bananas and grapes that Joe had before is 186 bananas + 93 grapes = <<186+93=279>>279 items\nWhen he bought 45 fewer bananas than grapes, he bought 83 bananas - 45 bananas = <<83-45=38>>38 bananas\nIn total, he bought 38 bananas + 83 grapes = <<38+83=121>>121 items\nAfter the purchases, Joe has 279 items + 121 items = <<279+121=400>>400 total bananas and grapes combined.\n#### 400", "id_orig": 406, "id_shuffled": 91}
