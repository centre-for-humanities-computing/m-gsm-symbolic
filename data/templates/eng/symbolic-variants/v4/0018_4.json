{"question": "Alex went to buy some school supplies. He bought 24 markers which cost $4.25 each, 8 folders which cost $5.25 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost $10. How much did Alex spend on everything?", "answer": "Alex spent 24*$4.25 = $<<24*4.25=102>>102 for the markers.\nHe also spent 8*$5.25 = $<<8*5.25=42>>42 for the folders.\nTherefore, Alex spent a total of $102 + $42 + $10 = $<<102+42+10=154>>154 for the school supplies.\n#### 154", "id_orig": 158, "id_shuffled": 18}
