{"question": "Maya walks 22 fts every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 fts of walking on the beach and 12 ft(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Maya walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 22-ft walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Maya walks at a rate of 10 fts per 40 minutes, or 10/40 = 1/4 fts per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/4 = 0.5 fts per minute.\nTo walk 12 ft(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 12/0.5 = <<12/0.5=24>>24 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Maya 40+24 = <<40+24=64>>64 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 64", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
