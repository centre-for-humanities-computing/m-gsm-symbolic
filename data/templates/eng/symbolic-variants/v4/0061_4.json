{"question": "Joe has a bag of buttons with 70 inside. He tripped over a stick while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 14. When he went back home, he inspected the buttons further. Five of the ones he picked up weren't buttons, but actually pebbles so he got rid of them. How many buttons did Joe end up with?", "answer": "Joe dropped his buttons and was left with 70*1/2=<<70*1/2=35>>35 buttons.\nHe searched and found some of his lost buttons, getting him back to 35+14=<<35+14=49>>49 buttons.\nHe went home and removed five pebbles, leaving him with 49-5=<<49-5=44>>44 buttons.\n#### 44", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
