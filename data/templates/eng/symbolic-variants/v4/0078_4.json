{"question": "There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Ethan has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 60 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/3 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 6+3=<<6+3=9>>9 classes a day\nThat means he spends 60*9=<<60*9=540>>540 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 540*6=<<540*6=3240>>3240 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 3240*1/3=<<3240*1/3=1080>>1080 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 3240+1080+1080=<<3240+1080+1080=5400>>5400 minutes per week\nSo he spends 5400/60=<<5400/60=90>>90 hours per week\n#### 90", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
