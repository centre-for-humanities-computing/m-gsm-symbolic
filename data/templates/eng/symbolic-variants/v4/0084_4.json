{"question": "Emma buys 17 shares of a stock for $30 each. The stock price increases 10% the first year Emma holds it, then decreases 45% in the second year. What is the final value of all Emma's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Emma's purchase: 17 shares * $30/share = $<<17*30=510>>510\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: $510 * 0.1 = $<<510*0.1=51>>51\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: $510 + $51 = $<<510+51=561>>561\nThen multiply that amount by 45% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: $561 * 45% = $<<561*45*.01=252.45>>252\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: $561 - $252 = $<<561-252=308>>308\n#### 308", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
