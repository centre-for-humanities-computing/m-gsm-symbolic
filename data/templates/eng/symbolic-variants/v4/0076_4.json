{"question": "Carl caught 3 cods last Friday, the first cod he caught weighs 44 pounds, the second cod he caught weighs 36 pounds, and the remaining cod he caught weighs 25 pounds. If a pound of cod costs £1.5, how much will he earn after selling all the cods to the market?", "answer": "Carl will earn 44*£1.5 = £<<44*1.5=66>>66 from the first cod.\nHe will earn 36*£1.5 = £<<36*1.5=54>>54 for the second cod.\nThe rest of the cods are 3-2 = <<3-2=1>>1. He will earn 25*£1.5 = £<<25*1.5=37.5>>37.5 per each of them. So he will earn 1 * 37.5 = <<1*37.5>>=37.5\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the cods is £66 + £54 + £37.5= £<<66+54+37.5=157>>157.\n#### 157", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
