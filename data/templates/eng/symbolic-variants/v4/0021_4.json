{"question": "Chris watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Saturday and Sunday, he watched a 2-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 60-minute show. On Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 4-hour episodes. If he watched 30 hours of TV in all, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Monday.\nAfter Saturday, he had 30 - 2 = <<30-2=28>>28 hours of TV left.\nAfter Sunday, he had 28 - 2 = <<28-2=26>>26 hours of TV left.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 26 - 3 - 0.75 = 22.25 hours of TV left.\nAfter Wednesday, he had 22.25 - 16 = 6.25 hours of TV left.\nEach 60-minute episode is 1 hour.\nThus, E = 6.25/1 = 6.25 episodes.\n#### 6.25", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
