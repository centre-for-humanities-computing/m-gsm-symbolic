{"question": "A group of 168 students has various hobbies. 47 like to hike, 3 like to play golf, and the rest like to either bake or paint. How many like to bake if the number that like to paint is twice the number that prefer playing golf?", "answer": "The number of students that like to paint is twice as many as the number who like golf, so 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6\nThe number that like to bake is 168 total students - 47 that like to hike - 3 that like to play golf - 6 that like to paint = <<168-47-3-6=112>>112\n#### 112", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
