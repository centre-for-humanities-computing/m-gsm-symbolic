{"question": "Lucas's truck breaks down. The truck weighs 1500 kilograms and he has equipment in it weighing 325 kilograms. He also has his three young children who weigh 75 kilograms each in it. If the force to move the truck is 2% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the truck?", "answer": "His three children weigh 75*3=<<75*3=225>>225 kilograms\nSo the total weight of the truck and everything is 1500+325+225=<<1500+325+225=2050>>2050 kilograms\nSo he needs to generate 2050*0.02=<<2050*0.02=41>>41 kilograms\n#### 41", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
