Claire already owns 21 flowers. Each flowering plant costs $13 at the store, how much money will Claire spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?", "answer": "Claire's flower bed is 160 feet / 4.75 feet per plant = <<160/4.75=33>>33 plants needed.\nClaire needs to buy 33 plants - 21 plants = <<33-21=12>>12 plants needed to purchase.\nClaire will spend 12 plants * $13 = $<<12*13=164>>164.\n#### 164", "id_orig": 984, "id_shuffled": 45}
