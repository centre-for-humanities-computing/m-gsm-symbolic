{"question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 325 calories per serving. If a 300 oz bag has 6 servings, how many ozs can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2050 and you have already consumed 1400 calories?", "answer": "If the total calorie target is 2050 and I have consumed 1400 calories then I have 2050-1400 = <<2050-1400=650>>650 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of breads has 325 calories and I only have 650 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 650/325 of a serving = 2 of a serving\nWe also know that a 300 oz bag of breads has 6 servings, hence each serving has 300 oz/6 = <<300/6=50>>50 ozs\nIf I can only eat 2 of a serving, then I can eat only 50 oz * 2 = 100 ozs\n#### 100", "id_orig": 43, "id_shuffled": 24}
