What percent of her spools are brown?", "answer": "First find the number of brown spools: 30 spools + 55 spools = <<30+55=85>>85 spools\nThen find the total number of spools: 50 spools + 85 spools + 85 spools = <<50+85+85=220>>220 spools\nThen divide the number of brown spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 85 spools / 220 spools * 100% = 38%\n#### 38", "id_orig": 728, "id_shuffled": 66}
