{"question": "Amanda is an avid gardener. Last night, she received 36 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 12 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Amanda remain with?", "answer": "Last night, before receiving the plants, Amanda had 12*40 = <<12*40=480>>480 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 36 plants, she therefore had a total of 480 + 36 = <<480+36=516>>516 potted plants\nTomorrow, Amandas plant giveaway will be 40*1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 516 - 40 = <<516-40=476>>476 potted plants.\n#### 476", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
