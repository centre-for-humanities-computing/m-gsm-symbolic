{"question": "Matt collects garbage from 6 different apartment complexes. The first five have 400 apartments each and the last one is 65% bigger than the other five combined. He collects garbage 4 times a week from each place and he gets paid $0.5 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first five complexes have 5*400=<<5*400=2000>>2000 apartments\nNumber 6 has 2000*0.65=<<2000*0.65=1300>>1300 more apartments than those five combined.\nSo in total, it has 2000+1300=<<2000+1300=3300>>3300 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 3300+2000=<<3300+2000=5300>>5300 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 5300*4=<<5300*4=21,200>>21,200 apartments every week\nSo he makes 21,200*$0.5=$<<21,200*0.5=10,600>>10,600 every week\n#### 10,600", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
