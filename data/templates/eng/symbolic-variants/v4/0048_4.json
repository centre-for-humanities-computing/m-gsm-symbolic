{"question": "Ellen can peel 10 clams a minute and saute 25 clams in 10 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 100 clams?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Ellen to peel the clams: 100 clams / 10 clams/minute = <<100/10=10>>10 minutes\nThen find how many batches of clams she needs to cook: 100 clams / 25 clams/batch = <<100/25=4>>4 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 4 batches * 10 minutes/batch = <<4*10=40>>40 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Ellen spends: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes\n#### 50", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
