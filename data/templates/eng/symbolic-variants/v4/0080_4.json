{"question": "The vending machines sell crackers for 40 cents and cookies for 50 cents. William spent $14 and got 7 bags of crackers and had 5% of his money left in change. How many cookies did he buy?", "answer": "William got $0.7 in change because $14*5/100 = <<14*5/100=0.7>>0.7\nWilliam spent $13.3 because 14 - 0.7 = <<14-0.7=13.3>>13.3\nWilliam spent $2.8 on crackers because 7*0.4 = <<7*0.4=2.8>>2.8\nWilliam spent 10.5 on cookies because 13.3 - 2.8 = <<13.3-2.8=10.5>>10.5\nWilliam bought 21 cookies because 10.5 / 0.5 = <<21=21>>21\n#### 21", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
