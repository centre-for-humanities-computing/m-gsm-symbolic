{"question": "Abby is knitting winter wear for her 5 grandchildren. They're quintuplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a vest, cardigan, hat, gloves, and socks for each of them. It takes 9 skeins of wool to make a vest, 7 for a cardigan, 5 for a hat, 4 for a pair of gloves, and 16 for a pair of socks. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 9 skeins per vest + 7 skeins per cardigan + 5 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per pair of gloves + 16 skeins per pair of socks = <<9+7+5+4+16=41>>41 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 5*41 = <<5*41=205>>205 skeins of wool.\n#### 205", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
