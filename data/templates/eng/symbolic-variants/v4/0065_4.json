{"question": "Claire is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire one financial advisor. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 6 fewer hours of freelance work, losing €36/hour in missed income. The financial advisor charges €183. How much more money will she have if she hires the financial advisor?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Claire does her taxes herself: €36/hour * 6 hours = €<<36*6=216>>216\nThen subtract the financial advisor's charge to find how much money Claire saves: €216 - €183 = €<<216-183=33>>33\n#### 33", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
