{"question": "One goblin can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a silver pickaxe and 30% more with a steel pickaxe than with a silver pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 26 goblins with steel pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a goblin can mine with an silver pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day\nThen multiply that amount by 130% to find how much a goblin can mine with a steel pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 130% = <<10*130*.01=13>>13 pounds/day\nThen multiply the amount one goblin can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe by the number of goblins: 13 pounds/day/goblin * 26 goblins = <<13*26=338>>338 pounds/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 338 pounds/day * 28 days = <<338*28=9464>>9464 pounds/day\n#### 9464", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
