{"question": "Emma and Sophie are sisters from Dallas who love collecting signatures from musicians. During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 8 weeks, Emma and Sophie compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Emma has 25 signatures in her book, and Sophie has 43. The sisters have 4 more weeks of summer break, and they decide they want to reach 105 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Emma and Sophie have already collected 25 + 43 signatures = <<25+43=68>>68 signatures.\nSince their goal is 105, they need to collect 105 - 68 signatures. 105 - 68 = <<105-68=37>>37 signatures\n#### 37", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
