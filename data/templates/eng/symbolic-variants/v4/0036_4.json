How much was the total cost?", "answer": "The total charge for the eclairs was 8*$20 = $<<8*20=160>>160.\nThe total charge for the tarts was 8*$80 = $<<8*80=640>>640.\nThe total charge for the muffins was 9*$119 = $<<9*119=1071>>1071.\nTherefore the total amount Andrea paid for the pastries was $160 + $640 + $1071 = $<<160+640+1071=1871>>1871.\n#### 1871", "id_orig": 11, "id_shuffled": 36}
