{"question": "Matt hires a party bus from 1 PM to 7 PM. He gets 2 hour(s) free. The first paid hour is £33 and each hour after that is four times the cost. How much did he pay?", "answer": "He got it for 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 hours\nHe pays for 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 hours\nThe first hour cost 1*33=£<<1*33=33>>33\nThe other 4-1=3 hours are more expensive\nThey cost 33*4=£<<33*4=132>>132 per hour\nSo those 3 hours cost 3*132=£<<3*132=396>>396\nSo he pays 396+33=£<<396+33=429>>429 in total\n#### 429", "id_orig": 652, "id_shuffled": 89}
