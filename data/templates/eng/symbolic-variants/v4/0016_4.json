On Wednesday, he sold 13 more boxes of cookies than on Tuesday and 25 boxes of apple pie. If the cookies cost $9 and the apple pie cost $33, how much did Tyler earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 30 + 13 = <<30+13=43>>43 boxes of cookies on Wednesday.\nThe total number of boxes of cookies that Tyler sold is 30 + 43 = <<30+43=73>>73.\nTyler earned 73*$9 = $<<73*9=657>>657 for selling cookies.\nHe sold 25 - 10 = <<25-10=15>>15 boxes of apple pie on Tuesday.\nThe total number of boxes of apple pie that Tyler sold is 25 + 15 = <<25+15=40>>40.\nHe earned 40*$33 = $<<40*33=1320>>1320 for selling apple pie.\nSo, Tyler earned $657 + $1320 = $<<657+1320=1977>>1977 for two days.\n#### 1977", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
