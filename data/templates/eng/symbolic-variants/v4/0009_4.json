{"question": "When Ellen watches her cousin, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 39 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 13 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 16 multicolored rings on it. Ellen recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her cousin up to 139. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Ellen has 39 + 13 + 16 + T = 68 + T = 139 toys for her cousin.\nThus, T = 139 - 68 = <<139-68=71>>71 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 71", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
