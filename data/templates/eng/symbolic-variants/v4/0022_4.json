Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 23 forks. How many forks were in the package that Sophia bought?", "answer": "The total number of forks from Sophia and her husband was 23+4=<<23+4=27>>27 forks.\nSince the husband bought a package of 7 forks, then Sophia's package contained 27-7=<<27-7=20>>20 forks.\n#### 20", "id_orig": 125, "id_shuffled": 22}
