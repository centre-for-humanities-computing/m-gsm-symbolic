{"question": "Carl goes to the store to buy some flour. The normal brand of flour he buys costs $9 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 10% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 3 kg of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a cookie for $2. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The flour he bought was 9*0.1=$<<9*0.1=0>>0 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 9+0=$<<9+0=9>>9 per kg\nHe goes through 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 kgs of flour a week\nSo he paid 9.9*21=$<<9.9*21=207>>207 on flour\nThat means his total bill was 207+2=$<<207+2=209>>209\n#### 209", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
