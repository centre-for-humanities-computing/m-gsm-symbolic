{"question": "In a set of scientist's cards, there are 32 blue cards, and 75% more orange cards. Purple cards are as many as the sum of blue and orange cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 75/100 * 32 = <<75/100*32=24>>24 more orange cards than blue cards.\nWhich means there are 32 + 24 = <<32+24=56>>56 orange cards.\nPurple cards make up to 32 + 56 = <<32+56=88>>88 cards.\nSo in total, there are 88 + 88 = <<88+88=176>>176 cards of different colors.\n#### 176", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
