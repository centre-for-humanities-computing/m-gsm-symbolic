{"question": "To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay €0.75 for each minute of your call. After 26 minutes, that price drops to €0.2 per minute. How much would a 55-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 26 minutes would be a cost of 26 * 0.75 = €<<26*0.75=19>>19.\nAfter that, there are 55 - 26 = <<55-26=29>>29 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 29 minutes cost 29 * 0.2 = €<<29*0.2=5>>5.\nSo in total, the 55-minute call would cost 19 + 5 = €24.\n#### 25", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
