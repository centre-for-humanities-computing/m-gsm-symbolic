{"question": "Ashley is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 60 pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then two times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to six times the initial popping rate in the next 30 seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Ashley takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Ashley have to eat?", "answer": "In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 2*60=<<2*60=120>>120 kernels pop.\nIn the third 30 seconds, 6*60=<<6*60=360>>360 kernels pop.\nIn the final 30 seconds, 360 / 2 = <<360/2=180>>180 kernels pop.\nAfter cooking, the residual heat makes 180 / 4 = <<180/4=45>>45 kernels pop.\nThus, Ashley has 60 + 120 + 360 + 180 + 45 = <<60+120+360+180+45=765>>765 pieces of popcorn to eat.\n#### 765", "id_orig": 1264, "id_shuffled": 4}
