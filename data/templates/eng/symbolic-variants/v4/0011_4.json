{"question": "David wants to make different sized ice cubes with 104 poundss of water. He can make giant cubes that use 6 poundss per cube, medium cubes that use 2 poundss, and small cubes that use 1/12 pounds. If he makes 7 giant cubes, 10 medium cubes, and 24 small cubes, how many poundss of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 42 poundss of water because 7 times 6 equals <<7*6=42>>42.\nThe medium cubes used up 20 poundss of water because 10 times 2 equals <<10*2=20>>20.\nThe small cubes used up 2 poundss of water because 24 times 1/12 equals 2.\nThis means that David has used up 64 poundss of water because 42 plus 20 plus 2 equals 64.\nDavid has 40 poundss of water left because 104 minus 64 equals <<104-64=40>>40.\n#### 40", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
