{"question": "Ellen qualified for a spot on the cycling team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a t-shirt for €25, a pair of cycling shorts for €13 more than the t-shirt cost, and a pair of sneakers that were originally €42 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for €2 off the package of €6 athletic headbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The shorts were €13 more than the t-shirt, so they cost €13 + €25 = €<<13+25=38>>38.\nHer sneakers were half the original €42 price, so they cost €42*1/2=€21.\nWith her coupon, the headbands were €6 - €2 = €<<6-2=4>>4.\nThe t-shirt, shorts, sneakers, and headbands together cost €25 + €38 + €21 + €4 = €<<25+38+21+4=88>>88.\n#### 88", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
