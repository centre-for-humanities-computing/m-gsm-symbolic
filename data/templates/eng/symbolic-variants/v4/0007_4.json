{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of oats, corns, beets and hay. Since hay are a rare treat, he only buys four 2-lb boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 12-lb bags. Oats are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys thirty-two 60-lb packs. Corns are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys twenty 50-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1500 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 lbs of hay.\nHe is buying 6*12 = <<6*12=72>>72 lbs of beets.\nHe is buying 20*50 = <<20*50=1000>>1000 lbs of corns.\nHe is buying 32*60 = <<32*60=1920>>1920 lbs of oats.\nThe weight of all the feed is 8 + 72 + 1000 + 1920 = <<8+72+1000+1920=3000>>3000 lbs.\nThus, the farmer needs 3000 / 1500 = <<3000/1500=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
