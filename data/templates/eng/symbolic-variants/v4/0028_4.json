{"question": "A hospital has a capacity of 1700 rooms with 1/10 occupied. Due to the pandemic, 30 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the hospital after 4 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/10 of the total capacity of the hospital rooms is occupied, it means 1/10 * 1700 = <<1700*1/10=170>>170 rooms have patients using them.\nThe total number of rooms in the hospital without new admissions is 1700 rooms - 170 rooms = <<1700-170=1530>>1530 rooms.\nIf 30 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 30 patients/day * 7 days/week = 210 patients.\nAfter 4 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 210 patients/week * 4 weeks = <<210*4=840>>840 patients, who each use one room.\nIf there were 1530 unoccupied rooms in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1530 rooms - 840 rooms = <<1530-840=690>>690 unoccupied rooms.\n#### 690", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
