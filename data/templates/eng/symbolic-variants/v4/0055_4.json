{"question": "Sarah is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the arabic abjad (with 28 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full twice, writes three quarters of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Sarah written in total?", "answer": "Sarah has written the arabic abjad (with 28 letters) twice which is a total of 28*2=<<28*2=56>>56 letters.\nShe then writes three quarters the arabic abjad (with 28 letters), which is 28*3/4=<<28*3/4=21>>21 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 56 + 21 = <<56+21=77>>77 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 77 * 2 = <<77*2=154>>154 letters.\n#### 154", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
