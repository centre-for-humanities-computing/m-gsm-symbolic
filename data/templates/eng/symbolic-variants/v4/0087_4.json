{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Water Wonderland is 310 meters long, and people slide down at 65 meters/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 300 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 75 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 310 meters / 65 meters/minute = <<310/65=4>>4 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 300 meters / 75 meters/minute = <<300/75=4>>4 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 4 minutes - 4 minutes = <<4-4=0>>0 minutes\n#### 0", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
