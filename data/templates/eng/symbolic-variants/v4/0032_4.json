{"question": "Mrs. Lee is looking for a townhouse that will not go beyond her $470,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $410,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 4% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the townhouse than Mrs. Lee's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $410,000*4/100 = $<<410,000*4/100=16,400>>16,400.\nThe transfer fee is $410,000*12/100 = $<<410,000*12/100=49,200>>49,200.\nThe total price of the townhouse is $410,000 + $16,400 + $49,200 = $475,600.\nSo, it is $475,600 - $470,000 = $<<475,600-470,000=5600>>5600 more than Mrs. Lee's budget.\n#### 5600", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
