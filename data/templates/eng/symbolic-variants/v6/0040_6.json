{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $37 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $3 per pound, get 1 pound 1/3 off.\" She scooped up 4 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $2.0 and 4 magnets that were $4.25 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound 1/3 off. So 1/3 off of 1 pound is $3*1/3 = $1. The rest of 2 pound does not have discount and costs 2*$3 = $6, so total is $3+$2+$6=$11\n4 magnets at $4.25 each is 4*4.25=$<<4*4.25=17>>17\nWhen you add all her purchases, 11+$2+$17 = $<<11+2+17=30>>30\nShe had $37 and spent $30 so she had $37-$30 = $<<37-30=7>>7 left over\n#### 7", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
