{"question": "Dr. Patel is looking for a condo that will not go beyond her $330,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $300,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 6% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the condo than Dr. Patel's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $300,000*6/100 = $<<300,000*6/100=18,000>>18,000.\nThe transfer fee is $300,000*12/100 = $<<300,000*12/100=36,000>>36,000.\nThe total price of the condo is $300,000 + $18,000 + $36,000 = $354,000.\nSo, it is $354,000 - $330,000 = $<<354,000-330,000=24,000>>24,000 more than Dr. Patel's budget.\n#### 24,000", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
