{"question": "Joshua works a 12-hour shift each day, three days a week. He earns £19 per hour and gets a £481 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Joshua make in June if the company performed very well for the whole month?", "answer": "In a day, Joshua makes 12 * 19 = £<<12*19=228>>228\nIf he works three days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 days.\nSince he makes £228 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 12 * 228= £<<12*228=2736>>2736.\nHe also got a 481 * 4 = £<<481*4=1924>>1924 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of June.\nAt the end of June, he earned 2736 + 1924 = £<<2736+1924=4660>>4660.\n#### 4660", "id_orig": 304, "id_shuffled": 60}
