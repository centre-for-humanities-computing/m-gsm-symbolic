{"question": "Matt hires a limousine from 4 PM to 10 PM. He gets 1 hour(s) free. The first paid hour is £15 and each hour after that is twice the cost. How much did he pay?", "answer": "He got it for 10-4=<<10-4=6>>6 hours\nHe pays for 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 hours\nThe first hour cost 1*15=£<<1*15=15>>15\nThe other 5-1=4 hours are more expensive\nThey cost 15*2=£<<15*2=30>>30 per hour\nSo those 4 hours cost 4*30=£<<4*30=120>>120\nSo he pays 120+15=£<<120+15=135>>135 in total\n#### 135", "id_orig": 652, "id_shuffled": 89}
