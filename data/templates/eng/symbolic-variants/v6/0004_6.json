{"question": "Ella is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 80 pop in the first 20 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 20 seconds. The kernels increase to seven times the initial popping rate in the next 20 seconds, but in the final 20 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 20 seconds. After Ella takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 20 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Ella have to eat?", "answer": "In the second 20 seconds of cooking, 3*80=<<3*80=240>>240 kernels pop.\nIn the third 20 seconds, 7*80=<<7*80=560>>560 kernels pop.\nIn the final 20 seconds, 560 / 2 = <<560/2=280>>280 kernels pop.\nAfter cooking, the residual heat makes 280 / 4 = <<280/4=70>>70 kernels pop.\nThus, Ella has 80 + 240 + 560 + 280 + 70 = <<80+240+560+280+70=1230>>1230 pieces of popcorn to eat.\n#### 1230", "id_orig": 1264, "id_shuffled": 4}
