{"question": "One miner can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe and 40% more with a bronze pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe. How many kgs of ore can 20 miners with bronze pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a miner can mine with an bronze pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 kgs/day\nThen multiply that amount by 140% to find how much a miner can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 kgs/day * 140% = <<10*140*.01=14>>14 kgs/day\nThen multiply the amount one miner can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of miners: 14 kgs/day/miner * 20 miners = <<14*20=280>>280 kgs/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 280 kgs/day * 30 days = <<280*30=8400>>8400 kgs/day\n#### 8400", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
