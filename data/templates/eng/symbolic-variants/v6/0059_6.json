{"question": "I have 12 liters of peach drink that are three quarters water and I wish to add it to 28 liters of apple drink that is one quarter water. But as I pour it, I spill four liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 36 liters?", "answer": "There are 28*1/4 = <<28*1/4=7>>7 liters of water from the 28 liters apple drink.\nAfter four liters of peach drink was spilled, there were 12-4 = <<12-4=8>>8 liters of peach drink left.\nOut of the 8 liters, 8*3/4 = <<8*3/4=6>>6 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 7 + 6 = <<7+6=13>>13 liters of water out of the 36 liters.\n#### 13", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
