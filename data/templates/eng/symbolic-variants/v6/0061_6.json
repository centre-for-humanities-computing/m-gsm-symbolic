{"question": "David has a bag of coins with 40 inside. He tripped over a stick while carrying it and dropped three quarters of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 14. When he went back home, he inspected the coins further. Nine of the ones he picked up weren't coins, but actually buttons so he got rid of them. How many coins did David end up with?", "answer": "David dropped his coins and was left with 40*1/4=<<40*1/4=10>>10 coins.\nHe searched and found some of his lost coins, getting him back to 10+14=<<10+14=24>>24 coins.\nHe went home and removed nine buttons, leaving him with 24-9=<<24-9=15>>15 coins.\n#### 15", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
