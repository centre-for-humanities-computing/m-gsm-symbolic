{"question": "Sarah is knitting winter wear for her 5 grandchildren. They're quintuplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a poncho, beanie, hat, gloves, and leg warmers for each of them. It takes 4 skeins of wool to make a poncho, 17 for a beanie, 3 for a hat, 6 for a pair of gloves, and 9 for a pair of leg warmers. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 4 skeins per poncho + 17 skeins per beanie + 3 skeins per hat + 6 skeins per pair of gloves + 9 skeins per pair of leg warmers = <<4+17+3+6+9=39>>39 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 5*39 = <<5*39=195>>195 skeins of wool.\n#### 195", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
