{"question": "Emma is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the arabic abjad (with 28 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full four times, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Emma written in total?", "answer": "Emma has written the arabic abjad (with 28 letters) four times which is a total of 28*4=<<28*4=112>>112 letters.\nShe then writes half the arabic abjad (with 28 letters), which is 28*1/2=<<28*1/2=14>>14 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 112 + 14 = <<112+14=126>>126 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 126 * 2 = <<126*2=252>>252 letters.\n#### 252", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
