{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys a variety of oats, apples, beets and hay. Since hay are a rare treat, he only buys six 2-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the cows while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Oats are the main diet of his cows, so he buys forty-two 70-pound packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys twenty 60-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2100 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 pounds of hay.\nHe is buying 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 pounds of beets.\nHe is buying 20*60 = <<20*60=1200>>1200 pounds of apples.\nHe is buying 42*70 = <<42*70=2940>>2940 pounds of oats.\nThe weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 1200 + 2940 = <<12+48+1200+2940=4200>>4200 pounds.\nThus, the farmer needs 4200 / 2100 = <<4200/2100=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
