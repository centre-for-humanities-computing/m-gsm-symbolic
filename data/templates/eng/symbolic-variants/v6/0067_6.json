{"question": "William's truck breaks down. The truck weighs 2350 pounds and he has equipment in it weighing 125 pounds. He also has his four young colleagues who weigh 75 pounds each in it. If the force to move the truck is 2% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the truck?", "answer": "His four colleagues weigh 75*4=<<75*4=300>>300 pounds\nSo the total weight of the truck and everything is 2350+125+300=<<2350+125+300=2775>>2775 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 2775*0.02=<<2775*0.02=55>>55 pounds\n#### 55", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
