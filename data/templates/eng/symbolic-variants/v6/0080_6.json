{"question": "The vending machines sell pretzels for 50 cents and cookies for 70 cents. William spent £10 and got 7 bags of pretzels and had 9% of his money left in change. How many cookies did he buy?", "answer": "William got £0.9 in change because £10*9/100 = <<10*9/100=0.9>>0.9\nWilliam spent £9.1 because 10 - 0.9 = <<10-0.9=9.1>>9.1\nWilliam spent £3.5 on pretzels because 7*0.5 = <<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5\nWilliam spent 5.6 on cookies because 9.1 - 3.5 = <<9.1-3.5=5.6>>5.6\nWilliam bought 8 cookies because 5.6 / 0.7 = <<8=8>>8\n#### 8", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
