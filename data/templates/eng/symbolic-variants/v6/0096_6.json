{"question": "Andrea's mom said that she had €50 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have €10 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is €5. The go-karts cost €5 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The go-karts will cost €10 per person because 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10\nEach person costs €25 because 10 + 5 + 10 = <<10+5+10=25>>25\n2 total people can attend because 50 / 25 = <<50/25=2>>2\nShe can invite 1 friends because 2 - 1 =<<2-1=1>>1\n#### 1", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
