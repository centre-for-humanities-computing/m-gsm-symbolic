{"question": "In a 150-item quiz, 50% of the questions are physics, and the rest are equally divided as economics and history questions. If Ashley is sure to get 20% of the physics questions, and one quarter of the economics and history questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?", "answer": "The economics and history questions comprises 100% - 50% = 50% of the quiz.\nThere are 150 questions*50/100 = <<150*50/100=75>>75 physics questions.\nThere are a total of 150 questions*50/100 = <<150*50/100=75>>75 economics and history questions.\nIf Ashley is sure to get 20% of the physics questions, then this means she is sure of her 75 questions*20/100 = <<75*20/100=15>>15 points.\nFrom the economics and history questions, she is sure to get one quarter of it correctly so that is 75 questions*1/4 = <<75*1/4=18>>18 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 15 points + 18 points = <<15+18=33>>33 points in her quiz.\n#### 33", "id_orig": 1021, "id_shuffled": 19}
