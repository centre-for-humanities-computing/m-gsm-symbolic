{"question": "Jessica buys 14 shares of a stock for €23 each. The stock price increases 95% the first year Jessica holds it, then decreases 5% in the second year. What is the final value of all Jessica's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Jessica's purchase: 14 shares * €23/share = €<<14*23=322>>322\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: €322 * 0.95 = €<<322*0.95=305.9>>305\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: €322 + €305.9 = €<<322+305.9=627.9>>627\nThen multiply that amount by 5% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: €627.9 * 5% = €<<627.9*5*.01=31.395>>31\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: €627 - €31 = €<<627-31=596>>596\n#### 596", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
