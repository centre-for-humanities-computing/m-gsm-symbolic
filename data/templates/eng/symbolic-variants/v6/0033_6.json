{"question": "Lily and Laura are sisters from Houston who love collecting signatures from movie stars. During their winter break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Lily and Laura compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Lily has 25 signatures in her book, and Laura has 37. The sisters have 2 more weeks of winter break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Lily and Laura have already collected 25 + 37 signatures = <<25+37=62>>62 signatures.\nSince their goal is 145, they need to collect 145 - 62 signatures. 145 - 62 = <<145-62=83>>83 signatures\n#### 83", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
