{"question": "A cleaner has to clean a hospital with 60 rooms. They have 4 days to get it done. It takes them 30 minutes per room. If they work 15 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?", "answer": "They have to clean 15 rooms a day because 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15\nThey spend 450 minutes cleaning per day because 15*30 = <<15*30=450>>450\nThey spend 7.5 hours a day because 450 / 60 = <<450/60=7.5>>7.5\nThey spend 1/2 of their day cleaning rooms because 7.5 / 15 = <<7.5/15=0.5>>0.5\nThey spend 50% of their day cleaning rooms because 0.5*100 = <<0.5*100=50>>50\n#### 50", "id_orig": 1239, "id_shuffled": 39}
