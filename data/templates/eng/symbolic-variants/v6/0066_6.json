{"question": "Amanda has 70 light green spools of thread, 75 dark green spools of thread, 65 light blue spools of thread, and 95 dark blue spools of thread. What percent of her spools are green?", "answer": "First find the number of green spools: 70 spools + 75 spools = <<70+75=145>>145 spools\nThen find the total number of spools: 65 spools + 95 spools + 145 spools = <<65+95+145=305>>305 spools\nThen divide the number of green spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 145 spools / 305 spools * 100% = 47%\n#### 47", "id_orig": 728, "id_shuffled": 66}
