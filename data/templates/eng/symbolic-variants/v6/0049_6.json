{"question": "Joshua collects garbage from 6 different apartment complexes. The first five have 400 apartments each and the last one is 55% bigger than the other five combined. He collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.2 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first five complexes have 5*400=<<5*400=2000>>2000 apartments\nNumber 6 has 2000*0.55=<<2000*0.55=1100>>1100 more apartments than those five combined.\nSo in total, it has 2000+1100=<<2000+1100=3100>>3100 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 3100+2000=<<3100+2000=5100>>5100 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 5100*2=<<5100*2=10,200>>10,200 apartments every week\nSo he makes 10,200*€0.2=€<<10,200*0.2=2040>>2040 every week\n#### 2040", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
