{"question": "When Sophie watches her cousin, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 25 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 21 multicolored rings on it. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her cousin up to 121. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 31 + 25 + 21 + T = 77 + T = 121 toys for her cousin.\nThus, T = 121 - 77 = <<121-77=44>>44 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 44", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
