{"question": "Chris caught 6 tunes last Friday, the first tune he caught weighs 57 kilograms, the second tune he caught weighs 37 kilograms, and the remaining tune he caught weighs 24 kilograms. If a kilogram of tune costs €1.0, how much will he earn after selling all the tunes to the market?", "answer": "Chris will earn 57*€1 = €<<57*1=57>>57 from the first tune.\nHe will earn 37*€1 = €<<37*1=37>>37 for the second tune.\nThe rest of the tunes are 6-2 = <<6-2=4>>4. He will earn 24*€1 = €<<24*1=24>>24 per each of them. So he will earn 4 * 24 = <<4*24>>=96\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunes is €57 + €37 + €96= €<<57+37+96=190>>190.\n#### 190", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
