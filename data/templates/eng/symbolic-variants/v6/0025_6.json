{"question": "In Mrs. Garcia's class of 78 students, 43% of the class are basketball players. Out of the remaining class, 17% of the students are choir members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "43% of the 78 student class are basketball players so that's 0.43*78 = <<0.43*78=33>>33 students\nThere are 78 students and 33 are basketball players so that leaves 78-33 = <<78-33=45>>45 students\n17% of the remaining 45 students are part of dancers or choir members so that's 0.17*45 = <<0.17*45=7>>7 students\n33 students are basketball players and 7 are part of dancers/choir members so 33+7 = <<33+7=41>>41 students will be leaving early\n#### 41", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
