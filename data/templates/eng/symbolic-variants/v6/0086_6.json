{"question": "Emily qualified for a spot on the cycling team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a sports bra for £25, a pair of cycling leggings for £7 more than the sports bra cost, and a pair of athletic shoes that were originally £64 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for £2 off the package of £5 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The leggings were £7 more than the sports bra, so they cost £7 + £25 = £<<7+25=32>>32.\nHer athletic shoes were half the original £64 price, so they cost £64*1/2=£32.\nWith her coupon, the socks were £5 - £2 = £<<5-2=3>>3.\nThe sports bra, leggings, athletic shoes, and socks together cost £25 + £32 + £32 + £3 = £<<25+32+32+3=92>>92.\n#### 92", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
