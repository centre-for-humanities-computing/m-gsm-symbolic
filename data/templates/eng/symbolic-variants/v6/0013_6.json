{"question": "Emily is an avid gardener. Last night, she received 43 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 5 potted plants on each of the 44 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Emily remain with?", "answer": "Last night, before receiving the plants, Emily had 5*44 = <<5*44=220>>220 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 43 plants, she therefore had a total of 220 + 43 = <<220+43=263>>263 potted plants\nTomorrow, Emilys plant giveaway will be 44*1 = <<44*1=44>>44 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 263 - 44 = <<263-44=219>>219 potted plants.\n#### 219", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
