{"question": "Ella can run thrice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is two thirds as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking?", "answer": "If Ella can skip at two thirds the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*3/2=<<6*3/2=9>>9 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is thrice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 9/3=3 miles per hour.\nIf half of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*1/2=<<6*1/2=3>>3 hours.\nIf half of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 hours.\nThus, she runs for 3 hours at 9 miles per hour, or 3*9=<<3*9=27>>27 miles.\nShe walks for 3 hours at 3 miles per hour, or 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 27+9=<<27+9=36>>36 miles.\n#### 36", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
