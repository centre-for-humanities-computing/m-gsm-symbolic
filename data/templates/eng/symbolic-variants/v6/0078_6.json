{"question": "There are 7 periods in the day for a normal student but Tyler has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. He goes to class for 5 days a week. He then spends 1/4 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 7+3=<<7+3=10>>10 classes a day\nThat means he spends 40*10=<<40*10=400>>400 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 400*5=<<400*5=2000>>2000 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 2000*1/4=<<2000*1/4=500>>500 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 2000+500+500=<<2000+500+500=3000>>3000 minutes per week\nSo he spends 3000/60=<<3000/60=50>>50 hours per week\n#### 50", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
