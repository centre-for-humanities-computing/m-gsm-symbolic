{"question": "To make a call from a phone booth, you must pay $0.5 for each minute of your call. After 32 minutes, that price drops to $0.25 per minute. How much would a 76-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 32 minutes would be a cost of 32 * 0.5 = $<<32*0.5=16>>16.\nAfter that, there are 76 - 32 = <<76-32=44>>44 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 44 minutes cost 44 * 0.25 = $<<44*0.25=11>>11.\nSo in total, the 76-minute call would cost 16 + 11 = $27.\n#### 27", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
