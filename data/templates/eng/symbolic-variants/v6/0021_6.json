{"question": "Henry watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched a 3-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 60-minute show. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 5-hour episode and a 15-minute show. On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 1-hour episodes. If he watched 22 hours of TV in all, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Thursday.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 22 - 3 = <<22-3=19>>19 hours of TV left.\nAfter Wednesday, he had 19 - 3 = <<19-3=16>>16 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 16 - 5 - 0.25 = 10.75 hours of TV left.\nAfter Saturday, he had 10.75 - 3 = 7.75 hours of TV left.\nEach 60-minute episode is 1 hour.\nThus, E = 7.75/1 = 7.75 episodes.\n#### 7.75", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
