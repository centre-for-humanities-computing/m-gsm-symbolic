{"question": "Madison walks 21 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 13 miles of walking on the beach and 8 mile(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Madison walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 52 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 21-mile walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Madison walks at a rate of 13 miles per 52 minutes, or 13/52 = 1/4 miles per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/4 = 0.5 miles per minute.\nTo walk 8 mile(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 8/0.5 = <<8/0.5=16>>16 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Madison 52+16 = <<52+16=68>>68 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 68", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
