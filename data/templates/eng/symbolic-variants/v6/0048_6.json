{"question": "Jessica can peel 10 onions a minute and saute 30 onions in 17 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 180 onions?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Jessica to peel the onions: 180 onions / 10 onions/minute = <<180/10=18>>18 minutes\nThen find how many batches of onions she needs to cook: 180 onions / 30 onions/batch = <<180/30=6>>6 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 6 batches * 17 minutes/batch = <<6*17=102>>102 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Jessica spends: 102 minutes + 18 minutes = <<102+18=120>>120 minutes\n#### 120", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
