{"question": "Ethan is selling cupcakes and grapes pie for a fundraiser. On Thursday, he sold 26 boxes of cupcakes and 18 fewer boxes of grapes pie, than on Friday. On Friday, he sold 15 more boxes of cupcakes than on Thursday and 19 boxes of grapes pie. If the cupcakes cost £7 and the grapes pie cost £21, how much did Ethan earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 26 + 15 = <<26+15=41>>41 boxes of cupcakes on Friday.\nThe total number of boxes of cupcakes that Ethan sold is 26 + 41 = <<26+41=67>>67.\nEthan earned 67*£7 = £<<67*7=469>>469 for selling cupcakes.\nHe sold 19 - 18 = <<19-18=1>>1 boxes of grapes pie on Thursday.\nThe total number of boxes of grapes pie that Ethan sold is 19 + 1 = <<19+1=20>>20.\nHe earned 20*£21 = £<<20*21=420>>420 for selling grapes pie.\nSo, Ethan earned £469 + £420 = £<<469+420=889>>889 for two days.\n#### 889", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
