{"question": "Alex is feeding his livestock grain. Each llama needs 7 kilograms, and each goat needs 7 kilograms less than twice the amount each llama needs. If there are 44 llamas and 30 goats, how many kilograms of grain does Alex need?", "answer": "First figure out how much grain each goat needs: 7 kilograms * 2 - 7 = <<7*2-7=7>>7 kilograms/goat\nNow figure out how much grain total the goats need: 7 kilograms/goat * 30 goats = <<7*30=210>>210 kilograms\nNow figure out how much grain total the llamas need: 7 kilograms/llama * 44 llamas = <<7*44=308>>308 kilograms\nNow add the two amounts of grain to find the total: 210 kilograms + 308 kilograms = <<210+308=518>>518 kilograms\n#### 518", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
