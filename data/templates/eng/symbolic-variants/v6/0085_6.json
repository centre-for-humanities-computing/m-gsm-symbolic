{"question": "If Oliver and Isabella have 220 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Isabella getting 150 feet more than Oliver, how much is left over for Oliver?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Oliver gets and y be the amount Isabella gets. We know that y = x + 150, and y + x = 220.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+150=220\nSubtracting the 150 from both sides, we get 2x=70\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=35. This means Oliver has 35 feet of fence left over.\n#### 35", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
