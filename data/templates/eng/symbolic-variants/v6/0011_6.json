{"question": "William wants to make different sized ice cubes with 216 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 3 ounces, and small cubes that use 1/3 ounce. If he makes 7 giant cubes, 10 medium cubes, and 24 small cubes, how many ounces of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 28 ounces of water because 7 times 4 equals <<7*4=28>>28.\nThe medium cubes used up 30 ounces of water because 10 times 3 equals <<10*3=30>>30.\nThe small cubes used up 8 ounces of water because 24 times 1/3 equals 8.\nThis means that William has used up 66 ounces of water because 28 plus 30 plus 8 equals 66.\nWilliam has 150 ounces of water left because 216 minus 66 equals <<216-66=150>>150.\n#### 150", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
