{"question": "A care facility has a capacity of 1200 beds with 1/8 occupied. Due to the flu season, 30 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the care facility after 3 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/8 of the total capacity of the care facility beds is occupied, it means 1/8 * 1200 = <<1200*1/8=150>>150 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the care facility without new admissions is 1200 beds - 150 beds = <<1200-150=1050>>1050 beds.\nIf 30 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the care facility after one week is 30 patients/day * 7 days/week = 210 patients.\nAfter 3 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the care facility is 210 patients/week * 3 weeks = <<210*3=630>>630 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 1050 unoccupied beds in the care facility before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1050 beds - 630 beds = <<1050-630=420>>420 unoccupied beds.\n#### 420", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
