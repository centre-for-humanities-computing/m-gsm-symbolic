{"question": "A parasite infects ten people. Every day, each infected person infects four others. How many people are infected after three days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original ten people infect four people each, so 10*4 = <<10*4=40>>40 more people are infected.\nThere are 10+40 = <<10+40=50>>50 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 50*4 = <<50*4=200>>200 more people are infected.\nThere are 50 + 200 = <<50+200=250>>250 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 250*4 = 1000 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 250 + 1000 = 1250 infected people after three days.\n#### 1250", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
