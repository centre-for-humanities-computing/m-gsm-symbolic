{"question": "Laura saw a 20-foot shark with 4 3-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 3 inches/remora * 4 remoras = <<3*4=12>>12 inches.\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<12/12=1>>1 foot.\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 20 feet * 100% = 5%\n\n#### 5", "id_orig": 473, "id_shuffled": 0}
