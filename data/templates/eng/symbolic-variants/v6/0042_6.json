{"question": "Ethan goes to the store to buy some flour. The normal brand of flour he buys costs $22 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 1 kg of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for $5. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The flour he bought was 22*0.4=$<<22*0.4=8>>8 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 22+8=$<<22+8=30>>30 per kg\nHe goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kgs of flour a week\nSo he paid 30.8*7=$<<30.8*7=215>>215 on flour\nThat means his total bill was 215+5=$<<215+5=220>>220\n#### 220", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
