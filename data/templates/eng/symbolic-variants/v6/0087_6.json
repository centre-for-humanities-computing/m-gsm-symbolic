{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Aqua Adventure is 270 yards long, and people slide down at 55 yards/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 250 yards long, but steeper, so people slide down at 90 yards/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 270 yards / 55 yards/minute = <<270/55=4>>4 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 250 yards / 90 yards/minute = <<250/90=2>>2 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 4 minutes - 2 minutes = <<4-2=2>>2 minutes\n#### 2", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
