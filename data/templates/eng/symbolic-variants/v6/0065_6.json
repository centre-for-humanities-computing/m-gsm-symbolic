{"question": "Emily is trying to decide whether to do her business accounting herself or hire one financial advisor. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 13 fewer hours of contract work, losing €32/hour in missed income. The financial advisor charges €59. How much more money will she have if she hires the financial advisor?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Emily does her business accounting herself: €32/hour * 13 hours = €<<32*13=416>>416\nThen subtract the financial advisor's charge to find how much money Emily saves: €416 - €59 = €<<416-59=357>>357\n#### 357", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
