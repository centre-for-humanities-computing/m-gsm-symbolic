{"question": "Matt collects garbage from 6 different apartment complexes. The first five have 100 apartments each and the last one is 55% bigger than the other five combined. He collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.35000000000000003 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first five complexes have 5*100=<<5*100=500>>500 apartments\nNumber 6 has 500*0.55=<<500*0.55=275>>275 more apartments than those five combined.\nSo in total, it has 500+275=<<500+275=775>>775 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 775+500=<<775+500=1275>>1275 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 1275*2=<<1275*2=2550>>2550 apartments every week\nSo he makes 2550*€0.35000000000000003=€<<2550*0.35000000000000003=892>>892 every week\n#### 892", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
