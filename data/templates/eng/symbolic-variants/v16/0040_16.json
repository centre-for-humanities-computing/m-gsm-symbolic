{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $16 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $4 per pound, get 1 pound 1/12 off.\" She scooped up 3 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.0 and 10 magnets that were $0.0 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $4 and gets 1 pound 1/12 off. So 1/12 off of 1 pound is $4*1/12 = $0.3333333333333333. The rest of 1 pound does not have discount and costs 1*$4 = $4, so total is $4+$11/3+$4=$35/3\n10 magnets at $0 each is 10*0=$<<10*0=0>>0\nWhen you add all her purchases, 35/3+$1+$0 = $<<35/3+1+0=12>>12\nShe had $16 and spent $12 so she had $16-$12 = $<<16-12=4>>4 left over\n#### 4", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
