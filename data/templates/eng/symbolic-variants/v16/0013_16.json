{"question": "Ashley is an avid gardener. Last night, she received 24 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 6 potted plants on each of the 60 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 3 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Ashley remain with?", "answer": "Last night, before receiving the plants, Ashley had 6*60 = <<6*60=360>>360 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 24 plants, she therefore had a total of 360 + 24 = <<360+24=384>>384 potted plants\nTomorrow, Ashleys plant giveaway will be 60*3 = <<60*3=180>>180 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 384 - 180 = <<384-180=204>>204 potted plants.\n#### 204", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
