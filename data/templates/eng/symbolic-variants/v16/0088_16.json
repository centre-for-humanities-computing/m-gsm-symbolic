{"question": "Claire can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is three fifths as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends three quarters of the time running and one quarter of the time walking?", "answer": "If Claire can skip at three fifths the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*5/3=<<6*5/3=10>>10 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 10/2=5 miles per hour.\nIf one quarter of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 4*1/4=<<4*1/4=1>>1 hours.\nIf three quarters of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours.\nThus, she runs for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, or 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 miles.\nShe walks for 1 hours at 5 miles per hour, or 1*5=<<1*5=5>>5 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 30+5=<<30+5=35>>35 miles.\n#### 35", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
