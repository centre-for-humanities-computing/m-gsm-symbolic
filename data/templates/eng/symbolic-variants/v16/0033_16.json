{"question": "Maya and Olivia are sisters from Los Angeles who love collecting signatures from movie stars. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Maya and Olivia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Maya has 34 signatures in her book, and Olivia has 33. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 115 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Maya and Olivia have already collected 34 + 33 signatures = <<34+33=67>>67 signatures.\nSince their goal is 115, they need to collect 115 - 67 signatures. 115 - 67 = <<115-67=48>>48 signatures\n#### 48", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
