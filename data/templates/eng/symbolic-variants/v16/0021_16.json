{"question": "Matt watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Wednesday and Thursday, he watched a 2-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Friday, he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show. On Saturday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Sunday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 5-hour episodes. If he watched 25 hours of TV in all, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Friday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Friday.\nAfter Wednesday, he had 25 - 2 = <<25-2=23>>23 hours of TV left.\nAfter Thursday, he had 23 - 2 = <<23-2=21>>21 hours of TV left.\nAfter Saturday, he had 21 - 1 - 0.75 = 19.25 hours of TV left.\nAfter Sunday, he had 19.25 - 15 = 4.25 hours of TV left.\nEach 45-minute episode is 3/4 hour.\nThus, E = 4.25/0.75 = 5.666666666666667 episodes.\n#### 5.666666666666667", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
