{"question": "Ms. Johnson is looking for a townhouse that will not go beyond her $380,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $370,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 13% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the townhouse than Ms. Johnson's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $370,000*3/100 = $<<370,000*3/100=11,100>>11,100.\nThe transfer fee is $370,000*13/100 = $<<370,000*13/100=48,100>>48,100.\nThe total price of the townhouse is $370,000 + $11,100 + $48,100 = $429,200.\nSo, it is $429,200 - $380,000 = $<<429,200-380,000=49,200>>49,200 more than Ms. Johnson's budget.\n#### 49,200", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
