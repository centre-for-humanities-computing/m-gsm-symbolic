{"question": "Bob is feeding his livestock grain. Each pig needs 8 kg, and each duck needs 3 kg less than twice the amount each pig needs. If there are 44 pigs and 25 ducks, how many kg of grain does Bob need?", "answer": "First figure out how much grain each duck needs: 8 kg * 2 - 3 = <<8*2-3=13>>13 kg/duck\nNow figure out how much grain total the ducks need: 13 kg/duck * 25 ducks = <<13*25=325>>325 kg\nNow figure out how much grain total the pigs need: 8 kg/pig * 44 pigs = <<8*44=352>>352 kg\nNow add the two amounts of grain to find the total: 325 kg + 352 kg = <<325+352=677>>677 kg\n#### 677", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
