{"question": "Sarah can peel 4 mushrooms a minute and saute 20 mushrooms in 13 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 100 mushrooms?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Sarah to peel the mushrooms: 100 mushrooms / 4 mushrooms/minute = <<100/4=25>>25 minutes\nThen find how many batches of mushrooms she needs to cook: 100 mushrooms / 20 mushrooms/batch = <<100/20=5>>5 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 5 batches * 13 minutes/batch = <<5*13=65>>65 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Sarah spends: 65 minutes + 25 minutes = <<65+25=90>>90 minutes\n#### 90", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
