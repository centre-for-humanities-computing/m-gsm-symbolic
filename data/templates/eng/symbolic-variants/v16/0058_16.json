{"question": "One miner can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a nickel pickaxe and 40% more with a steel pickaxe than with a nickel pickaxe. How many kgs of ore can 25 miners with steel pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a miner can mine with an nickel pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 kgs/day\nThen multiply that amount by 140% to find how much a miner can mine with a steel pickaxe: 10 kgs/day * 140% = <<10*140*.01=14>>14 kgs/day\nThen multiply the amount one miner can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe by the number of miners: 14 kgs/day/miner * 25 miners = <<14*25=350>>350 kgs/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 350 kgs/day * 28 days = <<350*28=9800>>9800 kgs/day\n#### 9800", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
