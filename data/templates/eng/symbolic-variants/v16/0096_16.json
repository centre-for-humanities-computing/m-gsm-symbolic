{"question": "Lily's uncle said that she had £240 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of bowling, have £4 in game room tokens, and get to ride the bumper cars twice. A round of bowling is £10. The bumper cars cost £17 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The bumper cars will cost £34 per person because 17*2 = <<17*2=34>>34\nEach person costs £48 because 4 + 10 + 34 = <<4+10+34=48>>48\n5 total people can attend because 240 / 48 = <<240/48=5>>5\nShe can invite 4 friends because 5 - 1 =<<5-1=4>>4\n#### 4", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
