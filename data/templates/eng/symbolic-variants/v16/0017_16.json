{"question": "Ashley walks 23 fts every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 4 fts of walking on the beach and 19 ft(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ashley walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 23-ft walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Ashley walks at a rate of 4 fts per 40 minutes, or 4/40 = 1/10 fts per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/10 = 0.2 fts per minute.\nTo walk 19 ft(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 19/0.2 = <<19/0.2=95>>95 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Ashley 40+95 = <<40+95=135>>135 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 135", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
