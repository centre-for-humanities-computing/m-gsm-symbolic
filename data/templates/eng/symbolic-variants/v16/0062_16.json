{"question": "In a set of chef's cards, there are 69 orange cards, and 39% more blue cards. Purple cards are as many as the sum of orange and blue cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 39/100 * 69 = <<39/100*69=26>>26 more blue cards than orange cards.\nWhich means there are 69 + 26 = <<69+26=95>>95 blue cards.\nPurple cards make up to 69 + 95 = <<69+95=164>>164 cards.\nSo in total, there are 164 + 164 = <<164+164=328>>328 cards of different colors.\n#### 328", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
