{"question": "Lily is knitting winter wear for her 5 grandchildren. They're quintuplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a cardigan, vest, sweater, socks, and booties for each of them. It takes 17 skeins of wool to make a cardigan, 13 for a vest, 15 for a sweater, 16 for a pair of socks, and 12 for a pair of booties. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 17 skeins per cardigan + 13 skeins per vest + 15 skeins per sweater + 16 skeins per pair of socks + 12 skeins per pair of booties = <<17+13+15+16+12=73>>73 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 5*73 = <<5*73=365>>365 skeins of wool.\n#### 365", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
