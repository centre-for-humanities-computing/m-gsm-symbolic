{"question": "There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Eric has to take 4 extra classes. Each class is 50 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends 1/10 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10 classes a day\nThat means he spends 50*10=<<50*10=500>>500 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 500*4=<<500*4=2000>>2000 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 2000*1/10=<<2000*1/10=200>>200 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 2000+200+200=<<2000+200+200=2400>>2400 minutes per week\nSo he spends 2400/60=<<2400/60=40>>40 hours per week\n#### 40", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
