{"question": "David goes to the store to buy some tea. The normal brand of tea he buys costs €16 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 35% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses 2 kilogram of tea per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for €4. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The tea he bought was 16*0.35=€<<16*0.35=5>>5 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 16+5=€<<16+5=21>>21 per kilogram\nHe goes through 2*7=<<2*7=14>>14 kilograms of tea a week\nSo he paid 21.6*14=€<<21.6*14=302>>302 on tea\nThat means his total bill was 302+4=€<<302+4=306>>306\n#### 306", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
