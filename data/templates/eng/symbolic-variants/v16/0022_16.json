Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 25 plates. How many plates were in the package that Laura bought?", "answer": "The total number of plates from Laura and her husband was 25+4=<<25+4=29>>29 plates.\nSince the husband bought a package of 9 plates, then Laura's package contained 29-9=<<29-9=20>>20 plates.\n#### 20", "id_orig": 125, "id_shuffled": 22}
