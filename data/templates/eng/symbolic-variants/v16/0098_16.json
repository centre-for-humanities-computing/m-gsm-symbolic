{"question": "A bacteria infects five people. Every day, each infected person infects three others. How many people are infected after three days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original five people infect three people each, so 5*3 = <<5*3=15>>15 more people are infected.\nThere are 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 20*3 = <<20*3=60>>60 more people are infected.\nThere are 20 + 60 = <<20+60=80>>80 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 80*3 = 240 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 80 + 240 = 320 infected people after three days.\n#### 320", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
