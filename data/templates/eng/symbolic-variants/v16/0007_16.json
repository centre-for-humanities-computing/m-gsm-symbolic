{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of apples, wheats, cucumbers and oats. Since oats are a rare treat, he only buys six 2-oz boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 8-oz bags. Apples are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys thirty-four 60-oz packs. Wheats are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys fifteen 60-oz sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1500 ozs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 ozs of oats.\nHe is buying 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 ozs of cucumbers.\nHe is buying 15*60 = <<15*60=900>>900 ozs of wheats.\nHe is buying 34*60 = <<34*60=2040>>2040 ozs of apples.\nThe weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 900 + 2040 = <<12+48+900+2040=3000>>3000 ozs.\nThus, the farmer needs 3000 / 1500 = <<3000/1500=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
