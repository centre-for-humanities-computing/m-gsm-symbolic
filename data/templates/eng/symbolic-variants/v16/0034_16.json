{"question": "Dr. Johnson sold his house for $600,000. He paid the registration fees that amount to 1% of the selling price and also paid a agent fee that is 2% of the selling price. If he also paid $370,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Dr. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the house?", "answer": "Dr. Johnson paid $600,000*1/100 = $6000 for the registration fees.\nHe paid $600,000*2/100 = $12,000 for the agent fee.\nSo, Dr. Johnson paid a total of $6000 + $12,000 + $370,000 = $388,000 for the registration, agent, and loan fees.\nHence, Dr. Johnson's net proceeds is $600,000 - $388,000 = $212,000.\n#### 212,000", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
