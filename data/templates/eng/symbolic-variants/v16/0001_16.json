{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 298 minutes to cover every 40 miles of the city. If the city is 60 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 60/40 = <<60/40=1>>1 intervals of 298 minutes.\nThus, it will take 1 * 298 = <<1*298=298>>298 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 298", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
