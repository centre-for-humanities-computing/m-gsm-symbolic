{"question": "Amanda is trying to decide whether to do her financial planning herself or hire one bookkeeper. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 4 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $60/hour in missed income. The bookkeeper charges $184. How much more money will she have if she hires the bookkeeper?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Amanda does her financial planning herself: $60/hour * 4 hours = $<<60*4=240>>240\nThen subtract the bookkeeper's charge to find how much money Amanda saves: $240 - $184 = $<<240-184=56>>56\n#### 56", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
