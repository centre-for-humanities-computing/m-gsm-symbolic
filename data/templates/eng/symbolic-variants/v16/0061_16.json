{"question": "Joshua has a bag of pebbles with 36 inside. He tripped over a toy while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 5. When he went back home, he inspected the pebbles further. Three of the ones he picked up weren't pebbles, but actually coins so he got rid of them. How many pebbles did Joshua end up with?", "answer": "Joshua dropped his pebbles and was left with 36*1/2=<<36*1/2=18>>18 pebbles.\nHe searched and found some of his lost pebbles, getting him back to 18+5=<<18+5=23>>23 pebbles.\nHe went home and removed three coins, leaving him with 23-3=<<23-3=20>>20 pebbles.\n#### 20", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
