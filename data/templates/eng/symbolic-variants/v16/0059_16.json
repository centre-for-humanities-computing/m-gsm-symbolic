{"question": "I have 16 liters of peach drink that are three fifths water and I wish to add it to 21 liters of mango drink that is two thirds water. But as I pour it, I spill six liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 31 liters?", "answer": "There are 21*2/3 = <<21*2/3=14>>14 liters of water from the 21 liters mango drink.\nAfter six liters of peach drink was spilled, there were 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 liters of peach drink left.\nOut of the 10 liters, 10*3/5 = <<10*3/5=6>>6 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 14 + 6 = <<14+6=20>>20 liters of water out of the 31 liters.\n#### 20", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
