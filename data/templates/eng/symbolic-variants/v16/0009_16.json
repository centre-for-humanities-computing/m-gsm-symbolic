The tower of stacking rings has 23 multicolored rings on it. Lily recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her brother up to 208. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Lily has 49 + 49 + 23 + T = 121 + T = 208 toys for her brother.\nThus, T = 208 - 121 = <<208-121=87>>87 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 87", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
