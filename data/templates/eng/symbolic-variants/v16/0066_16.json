What percent of her spools are orange?", "answer": "First find the number of orange spools: 40 spools + 120 spools = <<40+120=160>>160 spools\nThen find the total number of spools: 30 spools + 50 spools + 160 spools = <<30+50+160=240>>240 spools\nThen divide the number of orange spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 160 spools / 240 spools * 100% = 66%\n#### 66", "id_orig": 728, "id_shuffled": 66}
