{"question": "Chris is selling cookies and pear pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 24 boxes of cookies and 16 fewer boxes of pear pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 13 more boxes of cookies than on Saturday and 23 boxes of pear pie. If the cookies cost £8 and the pear pie cost £21, how much did Chris earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 24 + 13 = <<24+13=37>>37 boxes of cookies on Sunday.\nThe total number of boxes of cookies that Chris sold is 24 + 37 = <<24+37=61>>61.\nChris earned 61*£8 = £<<61*8=488>>488 for selling cookies.\nHe sold 23 - 16 = <<23-16=7>>7 boxes of pear pie on Saturday.\nThe total number of boxes of pear pie that Chris sold is 23 + 7 = <<23+7=30>>30.\nHe earned 30*£21 = £<<30*21=630>>630 for selling pear pie.\nSo, Chris earned £488 + £630 = £<<488+630=1118>>1118 for two days.\n#### 1118", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
