{"question": "Eric wants to make different sized ice cubes with 128 lbs of water. He can make giant cubes that use 8 lbs per cube, medium cubes that use 7 lbs, and small cubes that use 1/6 lb. If he makes 5 giant cubes, 10 medium cubes, and 24 small cubes, how many lbs of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 40 lbs of water because 5 times 8 equals <<5*8=40>>40.\nThe medium cubes used up 70 lbs of water because 10 times 7 equals <<10*7=70>>70.\nThe small cubes used up 4 lbs of water because 24 times 1/6 equals 4.\nThis means that Eric has used up 114 lbs of water because 40 plus 70 plus 4 equals 114.\nEric has 14 lbs of water left because 128 minus 114 equals <<128-114=14>>14.\n#### 14", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
