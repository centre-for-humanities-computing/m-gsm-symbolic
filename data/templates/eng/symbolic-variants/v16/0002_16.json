{"question": "Joshua is rolling a 8-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?", "answer": "There are 6 numbers greater than 2 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 6/8=75%.\nThe chance of rolling one odd number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.\nThe difference between these two probabilities is 75% - 25% = 50%.\n#### 50", "id_orig": 184, "id_shuffled": 2}
