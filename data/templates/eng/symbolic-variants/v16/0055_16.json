{"question": "Isabella is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full four times, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Isabella written in total?", "answer": "Isabella has written the alphabet four times which is a total of 26*4=<<26*4=104>>104 letters.\nShe then writes half the alphabet, which is 26*1/2=<<26*1/2=13>>13 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 104 + 13 = <<104+13=117>>117 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 117 * 2 = <<117*2=234>>234 letters.\n#### 234", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
