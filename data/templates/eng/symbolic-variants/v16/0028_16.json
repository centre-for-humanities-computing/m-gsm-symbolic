{"question": "A clinic has a capacity of 1500 wards with 1/12 occupied. Due to the pandemic, 40 patients are admitted into the clinic each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied wards in the clinic after 3 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/12 of the total capacity of the clinic wards is occupied, it means 1/12 * 1500 = <<1500*1/12=125>>125 wards have patients using them.\nThe total number of wards in the clinic without new admissions is 1500 wards - 125 wards = <<1500-125=1375>>1375 wards.\nIf 40 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the clinic after one week is 40 patients/day * 7 days/week = 280 patients.\nAfter 3 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the clinic is 280 patients/week * 3 weeks = <<280*3=840>>840 patients, who each use one ward.\nIf there were 1375 unoccupied wards in the clinic before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1375 wards - 840 wards = <<1375-840=535>>535 unoccupied wards.\n#### 535", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
