{"question": "Anna buys 11 shares of a stock for €70 each. The stock price increases 90% the first year Anna holds it, then decreases 5% in the second year. What is the final value of all Anna's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Anna's purchase: 11 shares * €70/share = €<<11*70=770>>770\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: €770 * 0.9 = €<<770*0.9=693>>693\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: €770 + €693 = €<<770+693=1463>>1463\nThen multiply that amount by 5% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: €1463 * 5% = €<<1463*5*.01=73.15>>73\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: €1463 - €73 = €<<1463-73=1389>>1389\n#### 1389", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
