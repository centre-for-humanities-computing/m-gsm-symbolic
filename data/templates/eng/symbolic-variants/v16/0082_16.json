{"question": "At the beginning of the meeting, there were 59 teachers and 69 engineers. After two hours, 1/16 of the total number of people left. How many engineers are left if 26 teachers stayed at the meeting?", "answer": "There were a total of 59 teachers + 69 engineers = <<59+69=128>>128 people who attended the meeting.\nAfter two hours, 128 people * 1/16 = <<128*1/16=8>>8 people left the meeting.\nThis means 128 people - 8 people = <<128-8=120>>120 people stayed.\nOut of the 120 who stayed, 120 people - 26 teachers = <<120-26=94>>94 were engineers.\n#### 94", "id_orig": 320, "id_shuffled": 82}
