{"question": "The vending machines sell pretzels for 45 cents and cookies for 50 cents. Joe spent €11 and got 1 bags of pretzels and had 5% of his money left in change. How many cookies did he buy?", "answer": "Joe got €0.55 in change because €11*5/100 = <<11*5/100=0.55>>0.55\nJoe spent €10.45 because 11 - 0.55 = <<11-0.55=10.45>>10.45\nJoe spent €0.45 on pretzels because 1*0.45 = <<1*0.45=0.45>>0.45\nJoe spent 10 on cookies because 10.45 - 0.45 = <<10.45-0.45=10>>10\nJoe bought 20 cookies because 10 / 0.5 = <<20=20>>20\n#### 20", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
