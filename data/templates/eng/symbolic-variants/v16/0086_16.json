{"question": "Maya qualified for a spot on the cycling team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a sports bra for $9, a pair of cycling leggings for $14 more than the sports bra cost, and a pair of athletic shoes that were originally $58 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for $2 off the package of $9 athletic headbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The leggings were $14 more than the sports bra, so they cost $14 + $9 = $<<14+9=23>>23.\nHer athletic shoes were half the original $58 price, so they cost $58*1/2=$29.\nWith her coupon, the headbands were $9 - $2 = $<<9-2=7>>7.\nThe sports bra, leggings, athletic shoes, and headbands together cost $9 + $23 + $29 + $7 = $<<9+23+29+7=68>>68.\n#### 68", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
