{"question": "If Matt and Alex have 760 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Alex getting 20 yards more than Matt, how much is left over for Matt?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Matt gets and y be the amount Alex gets. We know that y = x + 20, and y + x = 760.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+20=760\nSubtracting the 20 from both sides, we get 2x=740\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=370. This means Matt has 370 yards of fence left over.\n#### 370", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
