{"question": "Jason's SUV breaks down. The SUV weighs 1850 kilograms and he has equipment in it weighing 175 kilograms. He also has his four young colleagues who weigh 65 kilograms each in it. If the force to move the SUV is 1% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the SUV?", "answer": "His four colleagues weigh 65*4=<<65*4=260>>260 kilograms\nSo the total weight of the SUV and everything is 1850+175+260=<<1850+175+260=2285>>2285 kilograms\nSo he needs to generate 2285*0.01=<<2285*0.01=22>>22 kilograms\n#### 22", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
