{"question": "When the water is cold Alex swims a kilometer in 27 minutes. When the water is warm Alex swims a kilometer in 2 minutes more than twice as long. How much longer does Alex take to swim 5 kilometers on a hot day than a cold day?", "answer": "Cold water kilometer = <<27=27>>27 minutes\nWarm water kilometer = 2+2*27=56 minutes\n5 kilometers in cold water: 5(27)=<<5*27=135>>135 minutes\n5 kilometers in warm water: 5(56)=<<5*56=280>>280 minutes\nAlex takes 280-135=<<280-135=145>>145 minutes longer\n#### 145", "id_orig": 554, "id_shuffled": 93}
