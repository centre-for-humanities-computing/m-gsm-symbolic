{"question": "Kenneth caught 7 trouts last Sunday, the first trout he caught weighs 66 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 41 kilograms, and the remaining trout he caught weighs 25 kilograms. If a kilogram of trout costs £1.25, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?", "answer": "Kenneth will earn 66*£1.25 = £<<66*1.25=82.5>>82.5 from the first trout.\nHe will earn 41*£1.25 = £<<41*1.25=51.25>>51.25 for the second trout.\nThe rest of the trouts are 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5. He will earn 25*£1.25 = £<<25*1.25=31.25>>31.25 per each of them. So he will earn 5 * 31.25 = <<5*31.25>>=156.25\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is £82.5 + £51.25 + £156.25= £<<82.5+51.25+156.25=289>>290.\n#### 290", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
