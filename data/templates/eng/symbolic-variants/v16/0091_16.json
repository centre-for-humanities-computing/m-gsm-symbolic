{"question": "At Eric's house, there are thrice as many figs as apples. He has a total of 24 apples in his house. Eric bought 64 more apples at the store and 40 fewer figs than the number of apples. Find the combined total of the number of figs and apples Eric has in the house?", "answer": "Before buying any fig and apple, Eric had thrice as many figs as apples, which is 24 apples*3 fig/apple = <<24*3=72>>72 figs\nThe total number of figs and apples that Eric had before is 72 figs + 24 apples = <<72+24=96>>96 items\nWhen he bought 40 fewer figs than apples, he bought 64 figs - 40 figs = <<64-40=24>>24 figs\nIn total, he bought 24 figs + 64 apples = <<24+64=88>>88 items\nAfter the purchases, Eric has 96 items + 88 items = <<96+88=184>>184 total figs and apples combined.\n#### 184", "id_orig": 406, "id_shuffled": 91}
