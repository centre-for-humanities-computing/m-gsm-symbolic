How much money did Noah make in March if the company performed very well for the whole month?", "answer": "In a day, Noah makes 7 * 14 = $<<7*14=98>>98\nIf he works three days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 days.\nSince he makes $98 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 12 * 98= $<<12*98=1176>>1176.\nHe also got a 510 * 4 = $<<510*4=2040>>2040 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of March.\nAt the end of March, he earned 1176 + 2040 = $<<1176+2040=3216>>3216.\n#### 3216", "id_orig": 304, "id_shuffled": 60}
