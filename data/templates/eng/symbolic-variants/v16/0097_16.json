{"question": "Ella operates the cash register exactly four times as fast as her less-experienced colleague Madison. Daily, Madison processes 80 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?", "answer": "While Madison is processing 80 orders in a day, Ella processes 80 orders/day*4=<<80*4=320>>320 orders/day.\nIn a day, they process 320 orders/day + 80 orders/day = <<320+80=400>>400 orders together.\nThe total number of orders the two processes in a week is 400 orders/day * 7 days/week = <<400*7=2800>>2800 orders\n#### 2800", "id_orig": 636, "id_shuffled": 97}
