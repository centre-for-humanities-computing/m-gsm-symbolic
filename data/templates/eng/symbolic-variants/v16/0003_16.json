{"question": "A group of 193 students has various hobbies. 92 like to play music, 10 like to play golf, and the rest like to either dance or bake. How many like to dance if the number that like to bake is twice the number that prefer playing golf?", "answer": "The number of students that like to bake is twice as many as the number who like golf, so 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20\nThe number that like to dance is 193 total students - 92 that like to play music - 10 that like to play golf - 20 that like to bake = <<193-92-10-20=71>>71\n#### 71", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
