{"question": "Amanda went to the bakery and bought various types of desserts. She bought 10 dozen donuts which cost $15 per dozen, 7 dozen macarons which cost $80 per dozen, and 9 dozen brownies for $119 per dozen. How much was the total cost?", "answer": "The total charge for the donuts was 10*$15 = $<<10*15=150>>150.\nThe total charge for the macarons was 7*$80 = $<<7*80=560>>560.\nThe total charge for the brownies was 9*$119 = $<<9*119=1071>>1071.\nTherefore the total amount Amanda paid for the desserts was $150 + $560 + $1071 = $<<150+560+1071=1781>>1781.\n#### 1781", "id_orig": 11, "id_shuffled": 36}
