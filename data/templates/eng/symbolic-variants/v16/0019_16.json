{"question": "In a 100-item quiz, 10% of the questions are history, and the rest are equally divided as physics and geometry questions. If Lily is sure to get 80% of the history questions, and one fifth of the physics and geometry questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?", "answer": "The physics and geometry questions comprises 100% - 10% = 90% of the quiz.\nThere are 100 questions*10/100 = <<100*10/100=10>>10 history questions.\nThere are a total of 100 questions*90/100 = <<100*90/100=90>>90 physics and geometry questions.\nIf Lily is sure to get 80% of the history questions, then this means she is sure of her 10 questions*80/100 = <<10*80/100=8>>8 points.\nFrom the physics and geometry questions, she is sure to get one fifth of it correctly so that is 90 questions*1/5 = <<90*1/5=18>>18 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 8 points + 18 points = <<8+18=26>>26 points in her quiz.\n#### 26", "id_orig": 1021, "id_shuffled": 19}
