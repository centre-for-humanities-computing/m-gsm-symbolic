{"question": "To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay $0.75 for each minute of your call. After 36 minutes, that price drops to $0.5 per minute. How much would a 79-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 36 minutes would be a cost of 36 * 0.75 = $<<36*0.75=27>>27.\nAfter that, there are 79 - 36 = <<79-36=43>>43 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 43 minutes cost 43 * 0.5 = $<<43*0.5=21>>21.\nSo in total, the 79-minute call would cost 27 + 21 = $48.\n#### 48", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
