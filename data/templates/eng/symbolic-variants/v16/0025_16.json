{"question": "In Mr. Smith's class of 43 students, 11% of the class are soccer players. Out of the remaining class, 33% of the students are dancers or part of robotics club members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "11% of the 43 student class are soccer players so that's 0.11*43 = <<0.11*43=4>>4 students\nThere are 43 students and 4 are soccer players so that leaves 43-4 = <<43-4=39>>39 students\n33% of the remaining 39 students are part of robotics club members or dancers so that's 0.33*39 = <<0.33*39=12>>12 students\n4 students are soccer players and 12 are part of robotics club members/dancers so 4+12 = <<4+12=17>>17 students will be leaving early\n#### 17", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
