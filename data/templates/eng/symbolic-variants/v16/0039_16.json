{"question": "A janitor has to clean a office building with 60 floors. They have 5 days to get it done. It takes them 15 minutes per floor. If they work 10 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?", "answer": "They have to clean 12 floors a day because 60 / 5 = <<60/5=12>>12\nThey spend 180 minutes cleaning per day because 12*15 = <<12*15=180>>180\nThey spend 3 hours a day because 180 / 60 = <<180/60=3>>3\nThey spend 3/10 of their day cleaning floors because 3 / 10 = <<3/10=0.3>>0.3\nThey spend 30% of their day cleaning floors because 0.3*100 = <<0.3*100=30>>30\n#### 30", "id_orig": 1239, "id_shuffled": 39}
