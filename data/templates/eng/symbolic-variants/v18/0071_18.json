{"question": "Lucas is feeding his livestock silage. Each pig needs 13 pounds, and each cow needs 7 pounds less than twice the amount each pig needs. If there are 30 pigs and 22 cows, how many pounds of silage does Lucas need?", "answer": "First figure out how much silage each cow needs: 13 pounds * 2 - 7 = <<13*2-7=19>>19 pounds/cow\nNow figure out how much silage total the cows need: 19 pounds/cow * 22 cows = <<19*22=418>>418 pounds\nNow figure out how much silage total the pigs need: 13 pounds/pig * 30 pigs = <<13*30=390>>390 pounds\nNow add the two amounts of silage to find the total: 418 pounds + 390 pounds = <<418+390=808>>808 pounds\n#### 808", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
