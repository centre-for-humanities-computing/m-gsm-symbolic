{"question": "Mrs. Lee is looking for a apartment that will not go beyond her $320,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $290,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 4% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 14% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the apartment than Mrs. Lee's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $290,000*4/100 = $<<290,000*4/100=11,600>>11,600.\nThe transfer fee is $290,000*14/100 = $<<290,000*14/100=40,600>>40,600.\nThe total price of the apartment is $290,000 + $11,600 + $40,600 = $342,200.\nSo, it is $342,200 - $320,000 = $<<342,200-320,000=22,200>>22,200 more than Mrs. Lee's budget.\n#### 22,200", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
