{"question": "I have 20 liters of mango drink that are two thirds water and I wish to add it to 30 liters of peach drink that is one fifth water. But as I pour it, I spill two liters of the mango drink. How much water is in the remaining 48 liters?", "answer": "There are 30*1/5 = <<30*1/5=6>>6 liters of water from the 30 liters peach drink.\nAfter two liters of mango drink was spilled, there were 20-2 = <<20-2=18>>18 liters of mango drink left.\nOut of the 18 liters, 18*2/3 = <<18*2/3=12>>12 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 6 + 12 = <<6+12=18>>18 liters of water out of the 48 liters.\n#### 18", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
