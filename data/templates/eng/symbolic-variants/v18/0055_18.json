{"question": "Amanda is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the farsi alphabet (with 32 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full five times, writes three quarters of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Amanda written in total?", "answer": "Amanda has written the farsi alphabet (with 32 letters) five times which is a total of 32*5=<<32*5=160>>160 letters.\nShe then writes three quarters the farsi alphabet (with 32 letters), which is 32*3/4=<<32*3/4=24>>24 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 160 + 24 = <<160+24=184>>184 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 184 * 2 = <<184*2=368>>368 letters.\n#### 368", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
