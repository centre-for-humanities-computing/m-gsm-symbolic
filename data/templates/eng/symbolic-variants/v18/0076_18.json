{"question": "Oliver caught 5 trouts last Friday, the first trout he caught weighs 73 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 39 kilograms, and the remaining trout he caught weighs 35 kilograms. If a kilogram of trout costs $1.0, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?", "answer": "Oliver will earn 73*$1 = $<<73*1=73>>73 from the first trout.\nHe will earn 39*$1 = $<<39*1=39>>39 for the second trout.\nThe rest of the trouts are 5-2 = <<5-2=3>>3. He will earn 35*$1 = $<<35*1=35>>35 per each of them. So he will earn 3 * 35 = <<3*35>>=105\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is $73 + $39 + $105= $<<73+39+105=217>>217.\n#### 217", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
