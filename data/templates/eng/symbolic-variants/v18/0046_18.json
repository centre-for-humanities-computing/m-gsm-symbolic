{"question": "Oakwood High School is holding graduation in their Sports Arena this year which has space for 4700 people. After accounting for 400 seats for graduates and 450 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?", "answer": "Add graduate and faculty seats together. 400 + 450 = <<400+450=850>>850 seats for faculty and graduates\nMinus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 4700 - 850 = <<4700-850=3850>>3850 remaining seats.\nDivide remaining seats by the number of graduates. 3850/400 = <<3850/400=9>>9 tickets\n#### 9", "id_orig": 1031, "id_shuffled": 46}
