{"question": "In a set of chef's cards, there are 44 yellow cards, and 27% more orange cards. Purple cards are as many as the sum of yellow and orange cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 27/100 * 44 = <<27/100*44=11>>11 more orange cards than yellow cards.\nWhich means there are 44 + 11 = <<44+11=55>>55 orange cards.\nPurple cards make up to 44 + 55 = <<44+55=99>>99 cards.\nSo in total, there are 99 + 99 = <<99+99=198>>198 cards of different colors.\n#### 198", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
