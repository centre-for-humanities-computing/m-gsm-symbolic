{"question": "Maya and Ashley are sisters from San Antonio who love collecting signatures from politicians. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 4 weeks, Maya and Ashley compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Maya has 32 signatures in her book, and Ashley has 48. The sisters have 3 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 120 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Maya and Ashley have already collected 32 + 48 signatures = <<32+48=80>>80 signatures.\nSince their goal is 120, they need to collect 120 - 80 signatures. 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 signatures\n#### 40", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
