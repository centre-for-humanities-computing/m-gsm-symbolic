{"question": "Emma is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 36 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 10 potted plants on each of the 48 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Emma remain with?", "answer": "Two days ago, before receiving the plants, Emma had 10*48 = <<10*48=480>>480 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 36 plants, she therefore had a total of 480 + 36 = <<480+36=516>>516 potted plants\nTomorrow, Emmas plant giveaway will be 48*6 = <<48*6=288>>288 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 516 - 288 = <<516-288=228>>228 potted plants.\n#### 228", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
