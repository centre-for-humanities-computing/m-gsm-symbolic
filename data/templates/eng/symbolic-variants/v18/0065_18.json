{"question": "Ella is trying to decide whether to do her business accounting herself or hire one bookkeeper. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 13 fewer hours of freelance work, losing €88/hour in missed income. The bookkeeper charges €122. How much more money will she have if she hires the bookkeeper?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Ella does her business accounting herself: €88/hour * 13 hours = €<<88*13=1144>>1144\nThen subtract the bookkeeper's charge to find how much money Ella saves: €1144 - €122 = €<<1144-122=1022>>1022\n#### 1022", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
