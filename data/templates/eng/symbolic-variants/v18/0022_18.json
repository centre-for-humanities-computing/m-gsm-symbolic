Later, her husband also bought a package of 18 new forks and gave them to Amanda. While Amanda was making the roast chicken, she used three of the forks to sample her roast chicken. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 17 forks. How many forks were in the package that Amanda bought?", "answer": "The total number of forks from Amanda and her husband was 17+3=<<17+3=20>>20 forks.\nSince the husband bought a package of 18 forks, then Amanda's package contained 20-18=<<20-18=2>>2 forks.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 125, "id_shuffled": 22}
