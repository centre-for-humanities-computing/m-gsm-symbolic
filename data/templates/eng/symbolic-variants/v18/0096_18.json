{"question": "Andrea's dad said that she had $180 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of bowling, have $6 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts thrice. A round of bowling is $3. The go-karts cost $17 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The go-karts will cost $51 per person because 17*3 = <<17*3=51>>51\nEach person costs $60 because 6 + 3 + 51 = <<6+3+51=60>>60\n3 total people can attend because 180 / 60 = <<180/60=3>>3\nShe can invite 2 friends because 3 - 1 =<<3-1=2>>2\n#### 2", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
