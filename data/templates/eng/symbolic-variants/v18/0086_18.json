{"question": "Ellen qualified for a spot on the soccer team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a sports bra for £9, a pair of soccer leggings for £14 more than the sports bra cost, and a pair of athletic shoes that were originally £60 but were on sale for one quarter price. She had a coupon for £4 off the package of £9 athletic headbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The leggings were £14 more than the sports bra, so they cost £14 + £9 = £<<14+9=23>>23.\nHer athletic shoes were one quarter the original £60 price, so they cost £60*1/4=£15.\nWith her coupon, the headbands were £9 - £4 = £<<9-4=5>>5.\nThe sports bra, leggings, athletic shoes, and headbands together cost £9 + £23 + £15 + £5 = £<<9+23+15+5=52>>52.\n#### 52", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
