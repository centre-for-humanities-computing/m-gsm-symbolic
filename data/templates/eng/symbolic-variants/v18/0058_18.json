{"question": "One gnome can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with wooden pickaxe. He can mine twice as much with a silver pickaxe and 60% more with a mithril pickaxe than with a silver pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 20 gnomes with mithril pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a gnome can mine with an silver pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day\nThen multiply that amount by 160% to find how much a gnome can mine with a mithril pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 160% = <<10*160*.01=16>>16 pounds/day\nThen multiply the amount one gnome can mine in a day with a mithril pickaxe by the number of gnomes: 16 pounds/day/gnome * 20 gnomes = <<16*20=320>>320 pounds/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 320 pounds/day * 28 days = <<320*28=8960>>8960 pounds/day\n#### 8960", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
