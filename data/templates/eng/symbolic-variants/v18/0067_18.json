{"question": "Bob's SUV breaks down. The SUV weighs 2700 kilograms and he has furniture in it weighing 475 kilograms. He also has his two young teammates who weigh 85 kilograms each in it. If the force to move the SUV is 2% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the SUV?", "answer": "His two teammates weigh 85*2=<<85*2=170>>170 kilograms\nSo the total weight of the SUV and everything is 2700+475+170=<<2700+475+170=3345>>3345 kilograms\nSo he needs to generate 3345*0.02=<<3345*0.02=66>>66 kilograms\n#### 66", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
