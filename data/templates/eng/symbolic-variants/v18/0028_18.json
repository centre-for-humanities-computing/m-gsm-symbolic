{"question": "A hospital has a capacity of 1800 beds with 1/3 occupied. Due to the natural disaster, 30 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 4 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/3 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/3 * 1800 = <<1800*1/3=600>>600 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1800 beds - 600 beds = <<1800-600=1200>>1200 beds.\nIf 30 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 30 patients/day * 7 days/week = 210 patients.\nAfter 4 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 210 patients/week * 4 weeks = <<210*4=840>>840 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 1200 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1200 beds - 840 beds = <<1200-840=360>>360 unoccupied beds.\n#### 360", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
