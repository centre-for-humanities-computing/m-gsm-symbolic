{"question": "Maya buys 13 shares of a stock for £48 each. The stock price increases 45% the first year Maya holds it, then decreases 40% in the second year. What is the final value of all Maya's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Maya's purchase: 13 shares * £48/share = £<<13*48=624>>624\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: £624 * 0.45 = £<<624*0.45=280.8>>280\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: £624 + £280.8 = £<<624+280.8=904.8>>904\nThen multiply that amount by 40% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: £904.8 * 40% = £<<904.8*40*.01=361.92>>361\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: £904 - £361 = £<<904-361=542>>542\n#### 542", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
