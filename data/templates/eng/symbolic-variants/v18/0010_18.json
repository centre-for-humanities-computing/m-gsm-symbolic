{"question": "To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay €0.75 for each minute of your call. After 18 minutes, that price drops to €0.5 per minute. How much would a 85-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 18 minutes would be a cost of 18 * 0.75 = €<<18*0.75=13>>13.\nAfter that, there are 85 - 18 = <<85-18=67>>67 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 67 minutes cost 67 * 0.5 = €<<67*0.5=33>>33.\nSo in total, the 85-minute call would cost 13 + 33 = €46.\n#### 47", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
