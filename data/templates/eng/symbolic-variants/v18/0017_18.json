{"question": "Abby walks 36 mis every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 19 mis of walking on the beach and 17 mi(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Abby walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 57 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 36-mi walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Abby walks at a rate of 19 mis per 57 minutes, or 19/57 = 1/3 mis per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/3 = 0.6666666666666666 mis per minute.\nTo walk 17 mi(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 17/0.6666666666666666 = <<17/0.6666666666666666=25.5>>25.5 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Abby 57+25.5 = <<57+25.5=82.5>>82.5 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 82.5", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
