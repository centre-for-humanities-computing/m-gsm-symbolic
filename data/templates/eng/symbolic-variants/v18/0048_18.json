{"question": "Lily can peel 5 onions a minute and saute 45 onions in 11 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 90 onions?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Lily to peel the onions: 90 onions / 5 onions/minute = <<90/5=18>>18 minutes\nThen find how many batches of onions she needs to cook: 90 onions / 45 onions/batch = <<90/45=2>>2 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 2 batches * 11 minutes/batch = <<2*11=22>>22 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Lily spends: 22 minutes + 18 minutes = <<22+18=40>>40 minutes\n#### 40", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
