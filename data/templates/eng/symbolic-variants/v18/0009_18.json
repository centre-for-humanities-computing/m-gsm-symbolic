The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. Sarah recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 185. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Sarah has 68 + 13 + 9 + T = 90 + T = 185 toys for her nephew.\nThus, T = 185 - 90 = <<185-90=95>>95 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 95", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
