{"question": "At the beginning of the conference, there were 55 nurses and 47 lawyers. After two hours, 1/6 of the total number of people left. How many lawyers are left if 28 nurses stayed at the conference?", "answer": "There were a total of 55 nurses + 47 lawyers = <<55+47=102>>102 people who attended the conference.\nAfter two hours, 102 people * 1/6 = <<102*1/6=17>>17 people left the conference.\nThis means 102 people - 17 people = <<102-17=85>>85 people stayed.\nOut of the 85 who stayed, 85 people - 28 nurses = <<85-28=57>>57 were lawyers.\n#### 57", "id_orig": 320, "id_shuffled": 82}
