{"question": "William has a bag of pebbles with 54 inside. He tripped over a toy while carrying it and dropped one third of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 17. When he went back home, he inspected the pebbles further. Four of the ones he picked up weren't pebbles, but actually beads so he got rid of them. How many pebbles did William end up with?", "answer": "William dropped his pebbles and was left with 54*2/3=<<54*2/3=36>>36 pebbles.\nHe searched and found some of his lost pebbles, getting him back to 36+17=<<36+17=53>>53 pebbles.\nHe went home and removed four beads, leaving him with 53-4=<<53-4=49>>49 pebbles.\n#### 49", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
