{"question": "Jason goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs $24 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 25% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 1 kilogram of rice per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for $2. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The rice he bought was 24*0.25=$<<24*0.25=6>>6 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 24+6=$<<24+6=30>>30 per kilogram\nHe goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kilograms of rice a week\nSo he paid 30*7=$<<30*7=210>>210 on rice\nThat means his total bill was 210+2=$<<210+2=212>>212\n#### 212", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
