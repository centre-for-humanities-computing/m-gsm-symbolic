{"question": "In Dr. Lee's class of 23 students, 29% of the class are soccer players. Out of the remaining class, 34% of the students are choir members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away meet. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "29% of the 23 student class are soccer players so that's 0.29*23 = <<0.29*23=6>>6 students\nThere are 23 students and 6 are soccer players so that leaves 23-6 = <<23-6=17>>17 students\n34% of the remaining 17 students are part of dancers or choir members so that's 0.34*17 = <<0.34*17=5>>5 students\n6 students are soccer players and 5 are part of dancers/choir members so 6+5 = <<6+5=12>>12 students will be leaving early\n#### 12", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
