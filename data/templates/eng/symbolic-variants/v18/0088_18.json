{"question": "Sophie can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is two thirds as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 4 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends two thirds of the time running and one third of the time walking?", "answer": "If Sophie can skip at two thirds the speed she can run, then she can run at 4*3/2=<<4*3/2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/2=3 miles per hour.\nIf one third of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*1/3=<<6*1/3=2>>2 hours.\nIf two thirds of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 hours.\nThus, she runs for 4 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 miles.\nShe walks for 2 hours at 3 miles per hour, or 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 24+6=<<24+6=30>>30 miles.\n#### 30", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
