{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 196 minutes to cover every 31 miles of the city. If the city is 25 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 25/31 = <<25/31=0>>0 intervals of 196 minutes.\nThus, it will take 0 * 196 = <<0*196=0>>0 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 0", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
