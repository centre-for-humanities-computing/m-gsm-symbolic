{"question": "The vending machines sell gum for 35 cents and cookies for 100 cents. Eric spent €10 and got 6 bags of gum and had 9% of his money left in change. How many cookies did he buy?", "answer": "Eric got €0.9 in change because €10*9/100 = <<10*9/100=0.9>>0.9\nEric spent €9.1 because 10 - 0.9 = <<10-0.9=9.1>>9.1\nEric spent €2.1 on gum because 6*0.35 = <<6*0.35=2.1>>2.1\nEric spent 7 on cookies because 9.1 - 2.1 = <<9.1-2.1=7>>7\nEric bought 7 cookies because 7 / 1 = <<7=7>>7\n#### 7", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
