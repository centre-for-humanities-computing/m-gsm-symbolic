{"question": "Kenneth collects garbage from 5 different apartment complexes. The first four have 400 apartments each and the last one is 40% bigger than the other four combined. He collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.4 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first four complexes have 4*400=<<4*400=1600>>1600 apartments\nNumber 5 has 1600*0.4=<<1600*0.4=640>>640 more apartments than those four combined.\nSo in total, it has 1600+640=<<1600+640=2240>>2240 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 2240+1600=<<2240+1600=3840>>3840 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 3840*5=<<3840*5=19,200>>19,200 apartments every week\nSo he makes 19,200*€0.4=€<<19,200*0.4=7680>>7680 every week\n#### 7680", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
