{"question": "A infection infects fifteen people. Every day, each infected person infects seven others. How many people are infected after three days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original fifteen people infect seven people each, so 15*7 = <<15*7=105>>105 more people are infected.\nThere are 15+105 = <<15+105=120>>120 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 120*7 = <<120*7=840>>840 more people are infected.\nThere are 120 + 840 = <<120+840=960>>960 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 960*7 = 6720 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 960 + 6720 = 7680 infected people after three days.\n#### 7680", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
