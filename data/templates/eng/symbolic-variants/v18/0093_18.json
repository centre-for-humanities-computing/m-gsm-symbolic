{"question": "When the water is cold Lucas swims a kilometer in 13 minutes. When the water is warm Lucas swims a kilometer in 4 minutes more than thrice as long. How much longer does Lucas take to swim 2 kilometers on a hot day than a cold day?", "answer": "Cold water kilometer = <<13=13>>13 minutes\nWarm water kilometer = 4+3*13=43 minutes\n2 kilometers in cold water: 2(13)=<<2*13=26>>26 minutes\n2 kilometers in warm water: 2(43)=<<2*43=86>>86 minutes\nLucas takes 86-26=<<86-26=60>>60 minutes longer\n#### 60", "id_orig": 554, "id_shuffled": 93}
