{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Neptunes Kingdom is 310 yards long, and people slide down at 65 yards/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 260 yards long, but steeper, so people slide down at 70 yards/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 310 yards / 65 yards/minute = <<310/65=4>>4 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 260 yards / 70 yards/minute = <<260/70=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 4 minutes - 3 minutes = <<4-3=1>>1 minutes\n#### 1", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
