{"question": "Claire went to the cafe and bought various types of treats. She bought 8 dozen danishes which cost $14 per dozen, 10 dozen tarts which cost $86 per dozen, and 4 dozen brownies for $120 per dozen. How much was the total cost?", "answer": "The total charge for the danishes was 8*$14 = $<<8*14=112>>112.\nThe total charge for the tarts was 10*$86 = $<<10*86=860>>860.\nThe total charge for the brownies was 4*$120 = $<<4*120=480>>480.\nTherefore the total amount Claire paid for the treats was $112 + $860 + $480 = $<<112+860+480=1452>>1452.\n#### 1452", "id_orig": 11, "id_shuffled": 36}
