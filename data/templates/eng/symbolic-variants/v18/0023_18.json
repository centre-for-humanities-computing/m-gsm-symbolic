{"question": "Sophia is knitting winter wear for her 2 grandchildren. They're twins, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a beanie, hat, shawl, mittens, and gloves for each of them. It takes 10 skeins of wool to make a beanie, 15 for a hat, 7 for a shawl, 14 for a pair of mittens, and 12 for a pair of gloves. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 10 skeins per beanie + 15 skeins per hat + 7 skeins per shawl + 14 skeins per pair of mittens + 12 skeins per pair of gloves = <<10+15+7+14+12=58>>58 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 2*58 = <<2*58=116>>116 skeins of wool.\n#### 116", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
