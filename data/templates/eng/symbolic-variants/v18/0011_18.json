{"question": "Joshua wants to make different sized ice cubes with 84 lbs of water. He can make giant cubes that use 7 lbs per cube, medium cubes that use 4 lbs, and small cubes that use 1/2 lb. If he makes 4 giant cubes, 9 medium cubes, and 14 small cubes, how many lbs of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 28 lbs of water because 4 times 7 equals <<4*7=28>>28.\nThe medium cubes used up 36 lbs of water because 9 times 4 equals <<9*4=36>>36.\nThe small cubes used up 7 lbs of water because 14 times 1/2 equals 7.\nThis means that Joshua has used up 71 lbs of water because 28 plus 36 plus 7 equals 71.\nJoshua has 13 lbs of water left because 84 minus 71 equals <<84-71=13>>13.\n#### 13", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
