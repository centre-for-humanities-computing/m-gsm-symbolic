{"question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 175 calories per serving. If a 300 ounces bag has 5 servings, how many ouncess can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2050 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?", "answer": "If the total calorie target is 2050 and I have consumed 1700 calories then I have 2050-1700 = <<2050-1700=350>>350 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of breads has 175 calories and I only have 350 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 350/175 of a serving = 2 of a serving\nWe also know that a 300 ounces bag of breads has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300 ounces/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 ouncess\nIf I can only eat 2 of a serving, then I can eat only 60 ounces * 2 = 120 ouncess\n#### 120", "id_orig": 43, "id_shuffled": 24}
