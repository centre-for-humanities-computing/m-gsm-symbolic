{"question": "If Oliver and Jason have 740 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Jason getting 40 yards more than Oliver, how much is left over for Oliver?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Oliver gets and y be the amount Jason gets. We know that y = x + 40, and y + x = 740.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+40=740\nSubtracting the 40 from both sides, we get 2x=700\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=350. This means Oliver has 350 yards of fence left over.\n#### 350", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
