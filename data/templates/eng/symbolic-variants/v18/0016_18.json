{"question": "Carl is selling brownies and melon pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 30 boxes of brownies and 8 fewer boxes of melon pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 13 more boxes of brownies than on Saturday and 17 boxes of melon pie. If the brownies cost $7 and the melon pie cost $28, how much did Carl earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 30 + 13 = <<30+13=43>>43 boxes of brownies on Sunday.\nThe total number of boxes of brownies that Carl sold is 30 + 43 = <<30+43=73>>73.\nCarl earned 73*$7 = $<<73*7=511>>511 for selling brownies.\nHe sold 17 - 8 = <<17-8=9>>9 boxes of melon pie on Saturday.\nThe total number of boxes of melon pie that Carl sold is 17 + 9 = <<17+9=26>>26.\nHe earned 26*$28 = $<<26*28=728>>728 for selling melon pie.\nSo, Carl earned $511 + $728 = $<<511+728=1239>>1239 for two days.\n#### 1239", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
