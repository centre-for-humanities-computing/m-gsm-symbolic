{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $22 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $2 per pound, get 1 pound 1/3 off.\" She scooped up 4 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $2.5 and 6 magnets that were $0.0 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $2 and gets 1 pound 1/3 off. So 1/3 off of 1 pound is $2*1/3 = $0.6666666666666666. The rest of 2 pound does not have discount and costs 2*$2 = $4, so total is $2+$4/3+$4=$22/3\n6 magnets at $0 each is 6*0=$<<6*0=0>>0\nWhen you add all her purchases, 22/3+$2.5+$0 = $<<22/3+2.5+0=9>>9\nShe had $22 and spent $9 so she had $22-$9 = $<<22-9=13>>13 left over\n#### 13", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
