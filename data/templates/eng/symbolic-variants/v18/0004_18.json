{"question": "Eric is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 20 pop in the first 20 seconds of cooking, then four times that amount in the next 20 seconds. The kernels increase to six times the initial popping rate in the next 20 seconds, but in the final 20 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 20 seconds. After Eric takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 20 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Eric have to eat?", "answer": "In the second 20 seconds of cooking, 4*20=<<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.\nIn the third 20 seconds, 6*20=<<6*20=120>>120 kernels pop.\nIn the final 20 seconds, 120 / 2 = <<120/2=60>>60 kernels pop.\nAfter cooking, the residual heat makes 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 kernels pop.\nThus, Eric has 20 + 80 + 120 + 60 + 15 = <<20+80+120+60+15=295>>295 pieces of popcorn to eat.\n#### 295", "id_orig": 1264, "id_shuffled": 4}
