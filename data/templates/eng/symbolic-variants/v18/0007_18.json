{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his sheep. He buys a variety of hay, corns, carrots and wheats. Since wheats are a rare treat, he only buys six 3-lb boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 12-lb bags. Hay are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys forty-two 75-lb packs. Corns are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys sixteen 60-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2100 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 lbs of wheats.\nHe is buying 6*12 = <<6*12=72>>72 lbs of carrots.\nHe is buying 16*60 = <<16*60=960>>960 lbs of corns.\nHe is buying 42*75 = <<42*75=3150>>3150 lbs of hay.\nThe weight of all the feed is 18 + 72 + 960 + 3150 = <<18+72+960+3150=4200>>4200 lbs.\nThus, the farmer needs 4200 / 2100 = <<4200/2100=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
