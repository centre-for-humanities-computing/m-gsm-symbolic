{"question": "Mr. Davis sold his apartment for $600,000. He paid the legal fees that amount to 1% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 4% of the selling price. If he also paid $530,000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment, how much is Mr. Davis's net proceeds from selling the apartment?", "answer": "Mr. Davis paid $600,000*1/100 = $6000 for the legal fees.\nHe paid $600,000*4/100 = $24,000 for the realtor fee.\nSo, Mr. Davis paid a total of $6000 + $24,000 + $530,000 = $560,000 for the legal, realtor, and loan fees.\nHence, Mr. Davis's net proceeds is $600,000 - $560,000 = $40,000.\n#### 40,000", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
