{"question": "There are 7 periods in the day for a normal student but Bob has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 60 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends 1/4 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 7+2=<<7+2=9>>9 classes a day\nThat means he spends 60*9=<<60*9=540>>540 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 540*4=<<540*4=2160>>2160 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 2160*1/4=<<2160*1/4=540>>540 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 2160+540+540=<<2160+540+540=3240>>3240 minutes per week\nSo he spends 3240/60=<<3240/60=54>>54 hours per week\n#### 54", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
