{"question": "A bacteria infects fifteen people. Every day, each infected person infects three others. How many people are infected after four days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original fifteen people infect three people each, so 15*3 = <<15*3=45>>45 more people are infected.\nThere are 15+45 = <<15+45=60>>60 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 60*3 = <<60*3=180>>180 more people are infected.\nThere are 60 + 180 = <<60+180=240>>240 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 240*3 = 720 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 240 + 720 = 3840 infected people after four days.\n#### 3840", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
