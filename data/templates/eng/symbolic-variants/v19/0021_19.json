{"question": "Tyler watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Thursday and Friday, he watched a 2-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Saturday, he watched a few episodes of a 60-minute show. On Sunday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Monday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 5-hour episodes. If he watched 27 hours of TV in all, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Saturday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Saturday.\nAfter Thursday, he had 27 - 2 = <<27-2=25>>25 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 25 - 2 = <<25-2=23>>23 hours of TV left.\nAfter Sunday, he had 23 - 1 - 0.75 = 21.25 hours of TV left.\nAfter Monday, he had 21.25 - 15 = 6.25 hours of TV left.\nEach 60-minute episode is 1 hour.\nThus, E = 6.25/1 = 6.25 episodes.\n#### 6.25", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
