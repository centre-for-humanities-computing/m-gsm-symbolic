{"question": "Ms. Johnson is looking for a townhouse that will not go beyond her $370,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $340,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 13% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the townhouse than Ms. Johnson's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $340,000*3/100 = $<<340,000*3/100=10,200>>10,200.\nThe transfer fee is $340,000*13/100 = $<<340,000*13/100=44,200>>44,200.\nThe total price of the townhouse is $340,000 + $10,200 + $44,200 = $394,400.\nSo, it is $394,400 - $370,000 = $<<394,400-370,000=24,400>>24,400 more than Ms. Johnson's budget.\n#### 24,400", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
