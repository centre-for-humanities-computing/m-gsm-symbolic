{"question": "Dr. Davis sold his villa for $790,000. He paid the legal fees that amount to 2% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 4% of the selling price. If he also paid $500,000 for the remaining loan amount of the villa, how much is Dr. Davis's net proceeds from selling the villa?", "answer": "Dr. Davis paid $790,000*2/100 = $15,800 for the legal fees.\nHe paid $790,000*4/100 = $31,600 for the realtor fee.\nSo, Dr. Davis paid a total of $15,800 + $31,600 + $500,000 = $547,400 for the legal, realtor, and loan fees.\nHence, Dr. Davis's net proceeds is $790,000 - $547,400 = $242,600.\n#### 242,600", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
