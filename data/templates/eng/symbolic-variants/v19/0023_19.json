{"question": "Ava is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a poncho, beanie, vest, mittens, and gloves for each of them. It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a poncho, 17 for a beanie, 12 for a vest, 15 for a pair of mittens, and 8 for a pair of gloves. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 5 skeins per poncho + 17 skeins per beanie + 12 skeins per vest + 15 skeins per pair of mittens + 8 skeins per pair of gloves = <<5+17+12+15+8=57>>57 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3*57 = <<3*57=171>>171 skeins of wool.\n#### 171", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
