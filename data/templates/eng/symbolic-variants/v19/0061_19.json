{"question": "Oliver has a bag of beads with 90 inside. He tripped over a rock while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 19. When he went back home, he inspected the beads further. Seven of the ones he picked up weren't beads, but actually pebbles so he got rid of them. How many beads did Oliver end up with?", "answer": "Oliver dropped his beads and was left with 90*1/2=<<90*1/2=45>>45 beads.\nHe searched and found some of his lost beads, getting him back to 45+19=<<45+19=64>>64 beads.\nHe went home and removed seven pebbles, leaving him with 64-7=<<64-7=57>>57 beads.\n#### 57", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
