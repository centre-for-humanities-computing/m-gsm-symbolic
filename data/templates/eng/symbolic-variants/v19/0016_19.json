{"question": "Henry is selling cookies and banana pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 21 boxes of cookies and 13 fewer boxes of banana pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 12 more boxes of cookies than on Saturday and 22 boxes of banana pie. If the cookies cost $11 and the banana pie cost $33, how much did Henry earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 21 + 12 = <<21+12=33>>33 boxes of cookies on Sunday.\nThe total number of boxes of cookies that Henry sold is 21 + 33 = <<21+33=54>>54.\nHenry earned 54*$11 = $<<54*11=594>>594 for selling cookies.\nHe sold 22 - 13 = <<22-13=9>>9 boxes of banana pie on Saturday.\nThe total number of boxes of banana pie that Henry sold is 22 + 9 = <<22+9=31>>31.\nHe earned 31*$33 = $<<31*33=1023>>1023 for selling banana pie.\nSo, Henry earned $594 + $1023 = $<<594+1023=1617>>1617 for two days.\n#### 1617", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
