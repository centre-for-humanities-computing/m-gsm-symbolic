{"question": "To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay €0.75 for each minute of your call. After 24 minutes, that price drops to €0.25 per minute. How much would a 36-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 24 minutes would be a cost of 24 * 0.75 = €<<24*0.75=18>>18.\nAfter that, there are 36 - 24 = <<36-24=12>>12 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 12 minutes cost 12 * 0.25 = €<<12*0.25=3>>3.\nSo in total, the 36-minute call would cost 18 + 3 = €21.\n#### 21", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
