{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Neptunes Kingdom is 380 meters long, and people slide down at 80 meters/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 300 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 85 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 380 meters / 80 meters/minute = <<380/80=4>>4 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 300 meters / 85 meters/minute = <<300/85=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 4 minutes - 3 minutes = <<4-3=1>>1 minutes\n#### 1", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
