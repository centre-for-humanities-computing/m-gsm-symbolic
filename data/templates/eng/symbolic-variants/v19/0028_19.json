{"question": "A care facility has a capacity of 1800 beds with 1/6 occupied. Due to the flu season, 65 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the care facility after 2 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/6 of the total capacity of the care facility beds is occupied, it means 1/6 * 1800 = <<1800*1/6=300>>300 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the care facility without new admissions is 1800 beds - 300 beds = <<1800-300=1500>>1500 beds.\nIf 65 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the care facility after one week is 65 patients/day * 7 days/week = 455 patients.\nAfter 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the care facility is 455 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<455*2=910>>910 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 1500 unoccupied beds in the care facility before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1500 beds - 910 beds = <<1500-910=590>>590 unoccupied beds.\n#### 590", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
