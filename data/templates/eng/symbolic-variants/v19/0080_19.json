{"question": "The vending machines sell pretzels for 85 cents and popcorn for 100 cents. Henry spent £12 and got 4 bags of pretzels and had 5% of his money left in change. How many popcorn did he buy?", "answer": "Henry got £0.6 in change because £12*5/100 = <<12*5/100=0.6>>0.6\nHenry spent £11.4 because 12 - 0.6 = <<12-0.6=11.4>>11.4\nHenry spent £3.4 on pretzels because 4*0.85 = <<4*0.85=3.4>>3.4\nHenry spent 8 on popcorn because 11.4 - 3.4 = <<11.4-3.4=8>>8\nHenry bought 8 popcorn because 8 / 1 = <<8=8>>8\n#### 8", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
