{"question": "In a set of scientist's cards, there are 24 blue cards, and 79% more red cards. Green cards are as many as the sum of blue and red cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 79/100 * 24 = <<79/100*24=18>>18 more red cards than blue cards.\nWhich means there are 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 red cards.\nGreen cards make up to 24 + 42 = <<24+42=66>>66 cards.\nSo in total, there are 66 + 66 = <<66+66=132>>132 cards of different colors.\n#### 132", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
