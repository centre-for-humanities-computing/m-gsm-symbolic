{"question": "Kenneth hires a boat from 2 PM to 7 PM. He gets 2 hour(s) free. The first paid hour is £17 and each hour after that is five times the cost. How much did he pay?", "answer": "He got it for 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 hours\nHe pays for 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 hours\nThe first hour cost 1*17=£<<1*17=17>>17\nThe other 3-1=2 hours are more expensive\nThey cost 17*5=£<<17*5=85>>85 per hour\nSo those 2 hours cost 2*85=£<<2*85=170>>170\nSo he pays 170+17=£<<170+17=187>>187 in total\n#### 187", "id_orig": 652, "id_shuffled": 89}
