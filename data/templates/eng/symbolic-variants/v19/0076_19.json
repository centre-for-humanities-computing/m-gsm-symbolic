{"question": "Joshua caught 3 trouts last Monday, the first trout he caught weighs 61 pounds, the second trout he caught weighs 37 pounds, and the remaining trout he caught weighs 39 pounds. If a pound of trout costs $1.0, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?", "answer": "Joshua will earn 61*$1 = $<<61*1=61>>61 from the first trout.\nHe will earn 37*$1 = $<<37*1=37>>37 for the second trout.\nThe rest of the trouts are 3-2 = <<3-2=1>>1. He will earn 39*$1 = $<<39*1=39>>39 per each of them. So he will earn 1 * 39 = <<1*39>>=39\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is $61 + $37 + $39= $<<61+37+39=137>>137.\n#### 137", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
