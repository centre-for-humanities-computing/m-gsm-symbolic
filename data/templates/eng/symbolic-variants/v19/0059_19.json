{"question": "I have 11 liters of apple drink that are two thirds water and I wish to add it to 24 liters of grape drink that is three quarters water. But as I pour it, I spill five liters of the apple drink. How much water is in the remaining 30 liters?", "answer": "There are 24*3/4 = <<24*3/4=18>>18 liters of water from the 24 liters grape drink.\nAfter five liters of apple drink was spilled, there were 11-5 = <<11-5=6>>6 liters of apple drink left.\nOut of the 6 liters, 6*2/3 = <<6*2/3=4>>4 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 18 + 4 = <<18+4=22>>22 liters of water out of the 30 liters.\n#### 22", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
