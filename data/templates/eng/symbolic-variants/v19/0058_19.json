{"question": "One goblin can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with wooden pickaxe. He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe and 70% more with a bronze pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 20 goblins with bronze pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a goblin can mine with an bronze pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day\nThen multiply that amount by 170% to find how much a goblin can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 170% = <<10*170*.01=17>>17 pounds/day\nThen multiply the amount one goblin can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of goblins: 17 pounds/day/goblin * 20 goblins = <<17*20=340>>340 pounds/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 340 pounds/day * 28 days = <<340*28=9520>>9520 pounds/day\n#### 9520", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
