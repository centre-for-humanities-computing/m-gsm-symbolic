{"question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 300 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many ozs can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2200 and you have already consumed 1750 calories?", "answer": "If the total calorie target is 2200 and I have consumed 1750 calories then I have 2200-1750 = <<2200-1750=450>>450 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of popcorn has 300 calories and I only have 450 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 450/300 of a serving = 3/2 of a serving\nWe also know that a 150 oz bag of popcorn has 5 servings, hence each serving has 150 oz/5 = <<150/5=30>>30 ozs\nIf I can only eat 3/2 of a serving, then I can eat only 30 oz * 3/2 = 45 ozs\n#### 45", "id_orig": 43, "id_shuffled": 24}
