{"question": "Eric wants to make different sized ice cubes with 76 ozs of water. He can make giant cubes that use 5 ozs per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ozs, and small cubes that use 1/2 oz. If he makes 7 giant cubes, 12 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many ozs of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 35 ozs of water because 7 times 5 equals <<7*5=35>>35.\nThe medium cubes used up 24 ozs of water because 12 times 2 equals <<12*2=24>>24.\nThe small cubes used up 4 ozs of water because 8 times 1/2 equals 4.\nThis means that Eric has used up 63 ozs of water because 35 plus 24 plus 4 equals 63.\nEric has 13 ozs of water left because 76 minus 63 equals <<76-63=13>>13.\n#### 13", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
