{"question": "Ava is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire one bookkeeper. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 5 fewer hours of part-time work, losing €80/hour in missed income. The bookkeeper charges €182. How much more money will she have if she hires the bookkeeper?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Ava does her taxes herself: €80/hour * 5 hours = €<<80*5=400>>400\nThen subtract the bookkeeper's charge to find how much money Ava saves: €400 - €182 = €<<400-182=218>>218\n#### 218", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
