{"question": "Sophie buys 9 shares of a stock for £29 each. The stock price increases 95% the first year Sophie holds it, then decreases 15% in the second year. What is the final value of all Sophie's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Sophie's purchase: 9 shares * £29/share = £<<9*29=261>>261\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: £261 * 0.95 = £<<261*0.95=247.95>>247\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: £261 + £247.95 = £<<261+247.95=508.95>>508\nThen multiply that amount by 15% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: £508.95 * 15% = £<<508.95*15*.01=76.3425>>76\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: £508 - £76 = £<<508-76=432>>432\n#### 432", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
