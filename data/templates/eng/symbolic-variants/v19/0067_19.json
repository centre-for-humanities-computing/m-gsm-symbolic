{"question": "Jason's truck breaks down. The truck weighs 1600 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 475 pounds. He also has his four young teammates who weigh 50 pounds each in it. If the force to move the truck is 1% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the truck?", "answer": "His four teammates weigh 50*4=<<50*4=200>>200 pounds\nSo the total weight of the truck and everything is 1600+475+200=<<1600+475+200=2275>>2275 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 2275*0.01=<<2275*0.01=22>>22 pounds\n#### 22", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
