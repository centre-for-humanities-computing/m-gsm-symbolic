{"question": "If Eric and Kenneth have 320 meters of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Kenneth getting 110 meters more than Eric, how much is left over for Eric?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Eric gets and y be the amount Kenneth gets. We know that y = x + 110, and y + x = 320.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+110=320\nSubtracting the 110 from both sides, we get 2x=210\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=105. This means Eric has 105 meters of fence left over.\n#### 105", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
