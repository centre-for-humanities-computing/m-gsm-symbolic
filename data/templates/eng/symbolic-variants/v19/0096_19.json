{"question": "Laura's dad said that she had $210 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of laser tag, have $4 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster thrice. A round of laser tag is $9. The roller coaster cost $19 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The roller coaster will cost $57 per person because 19*3 = <<19*3=57>>57\nEach person costs $70 because 4 + 9 + 57 = <<4+9+57=70>>70\n3 total people can attend because 210 / 70 = <<210/70=3>>3\nShe can invite 2 friends because 3 - 1 =<<3-1=2>>2\n#### 2", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
