{"question": "Lily can peel 12 mushrooms a minute and saute 20 mushrooms in 8 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 120 mushrooms?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Lily to peel the mushrooms: 120 mushrooms / 12 mushrooms/minute = <<120/12=10>>10 minutes\nThen find how many batches of mushrooms she needs to cook: 120 mushrooms / 20 mushrooms/batch = <<120/20=6>>6 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 6 batches * 8 minutes/batch = <<6*8=48>>48 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Lily spends: 48 minutes + 10 minutes = <<48+10=58>>58 minutes\n#### 58", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
