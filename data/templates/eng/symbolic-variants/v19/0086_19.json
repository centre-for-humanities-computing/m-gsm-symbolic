{"question": "Sophie qualified for a spot on the volleyball team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a jersey for €22, a pair of volleyball shorts for €8 more than the jersey cost, and a pair of athletic shoes that were originally €60 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for €4 off the package of €11 athletic wristbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The shorts were €8 more than the jersey, so they cost €8 + €22 = €<<8+22=30>>30.\nHer athletic shoes were half the original €60 price, so they cost €60*1/2=€30.\nWith her coupon, the wristbands were €11 - €4 = €<<11-4=7>>7.\nThe jersey, shorts, athletic shoes, and wristbands together cost €22 + €30 + €30 + €7 = €<<22+30+30+7=89>>89.\n#### 89", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
