{"question": "Oakwood High School is holding graduation in their Auditorium this year which has space for 3800 people. After accounting for 900 seats for graduates and 250 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?", "answer": "Add graduate and faculty seats together. 900 + 250 = <<900+250=1150>>1150 seats for faculty and graduates\nMinus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 3800 - 1150 = <<3800-1150=2650>>2650 remaining seats.\nDivide remaining seats by the number of graduates. 2650/900 = <<2650/900=2>>2 tickets\n#### 2", "id_orig": 1031, "id_shuffled": 46}
