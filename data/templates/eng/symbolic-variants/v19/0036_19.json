{"question": "Abby went to the patisserie and bought various types of treats. She bought 7 dozen croissants which cost $19 per dozen, 5 dozen macarons which cost $78 per dozen, and 8 dozen muffins for $119 per dozen. How much was the total cost?", "answer": "The total charge for the croissants was 7*$19 = $<<7*19=133>>133.\nThe total charge for the macarons was 5*$78 = $<<5*78=390>>390.\nThe total charge for the muffins was 8*$119 = $<<8*119=952>>952.\nTherefore the total amount Abby paid for the treats was $133 + $390 + $952 = $<<133+390+952=1475>>1475.\n#### 1475", "id_orig": 11, "id_shuffled": 36}
