{"question": "Henry saw a 70-foot shark with 7 12-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 12 inches/remora * 7 remoras = <<12*7=84>>84 inches.\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 84 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<84/12=7>>7 foot.\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 7 foot / 70 feet * 100% = 10%\n\n#### 10", "id_orig": 473, "id_shuffled": 0}
