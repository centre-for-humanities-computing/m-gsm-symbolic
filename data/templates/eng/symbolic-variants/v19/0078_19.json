{"question": "There are 5 periods in the day for a normal student but Michael has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 5+2=<<5+2=7>>7 classes a day\nThat means he spends 40*7=<<40*7=280>>280 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 280*4=<<280*4=1120>>1120 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1120*1/16=<<1120*1/16=70>>70 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 1120+70+70=<<1120+70+70=1260>>1260 minutes per week\nSo he spends 1260/60=<<1260/60=21>>21 hours per week\n#### 21", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
