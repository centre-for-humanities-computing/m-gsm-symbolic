{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of oats, apples, beets and corns. Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-ounce boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 8-ounce bags. Oats are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty-two 65-ounce packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys eighteen 65-ounce sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1650 ounces at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 ounces of corns.\nHe is buying 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 ounces of beets.\nHe is buying 18*65 = <<18*65=1170>>1170 ounces of apples.\nHe is buying 32*65 = <<32*65=2080>>2080 ounces of oats.\nThe weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 1170 + 2080 = <<2+48+1170+2080=3300>>3300 ounces.\nThus, the farmer needs 3300 / 1650 = <<3300/1650=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
