{"question": "Chris is popping popcorn for a snack. As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 20 pop in the first 22 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 22 seconds. The kernels increase to six times the initial popping rate in the next 22 seconds, but in the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 22 seconds. After Chris takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Chris have to eat?", "answer": "In the second 22 seconds of cooking, 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.\nIn the third 22 seconds, 6*20=<<6*20=120>>120 kernels pop.\nIn the final 22 seconds, 120 / 2 = <<120/2=60>>60 kernels pop.\nAfter cooking, the residual heat makes 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 kernels pop.\nThus, Chris has 20 + 60 + 120 + 60 + 15 = <<20+60+120+60+15=275>>275 pieces of popcorn to eat.\n#### 275", "id_orig": 1264, "id_shuffled": 4}
