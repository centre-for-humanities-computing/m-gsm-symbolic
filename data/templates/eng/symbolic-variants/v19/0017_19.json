{"question": "Isabella walks 26 yards every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 11 yards of walking on the beach and 15 yard(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Isabella walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 26-yard walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Isabella walks at a rate of 11 yards per 66 minutes, or 11/66 = 1/6 yards per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at four times the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 4*1/6 = 0.6666666666666666 yards per minute.\nTo walk 15 yard(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 15/0.6666666666666666 = <<15/0.6666666666666666=22.5>>22.5 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Isabella 66+22.5 = <<66+22.5=88.5>>88.5 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 88.5", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
