{"question": "A class of 119 students has various hobbies. 14 like to bake, 32 like to play cycling, and the rest like to either dance or read. How many like to dance if the number that like to read is twice the number that prefer playing cycling?", "answer": "The number of students that like to read is twice as many as the number who like cycling, so 2 * 32 = <<2*32=64>>64\nThe number that like to dance is 119 total students - 14 that like to bake - 32 that like to play cycling - 64 that like to read = <<119-14-32-64=9>>9\n#### 9", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
