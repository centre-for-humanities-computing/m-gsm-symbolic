{"question": "Andrea is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the hiragana (with 48 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full four times, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Andrea written in total?", "answer": "Andrea has written the hiragana (with 48 letters) four times which is a total of 48*4=<<48*4=192>>192 letters.\nShe then writes half the hiragana (with 48 letters), which is 48*1/2=<<48*1/2=24>>24 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 192 + 24 = <<192+24=216>>216 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 216 * 2 = <<216*2=432>>432 letters.\n#### 432", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
