{"question": "Sophie is an avid gardener. Last night, she received 31 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 11 potted plants on each of the 58 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 4 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Sophie remain with?", "answer": "Last night, before receiving the plants, Sophie had 11*58 = <<11*58=638>>638 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 31 plants, she therefore had a total of 638 + 31 = <<638+31=669>>669 potted plants\nTomorrow, Sophies plant giveaway will be 58*4 = <<58*4=232>>232 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 669 - 232 = <<669-232=437>>437 potted plants.\n#### 437", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
