{"question": "Joshua collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. The first two have 450 apartments each and the last one is 55% bigger than the other two combined. He collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid £0.45 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first two complexes have 2*450=<<2*450=900>>900 apartments\nNumber 3 has 900*0.55=<<900*0.55=495>>495 more apartments than those two combined.\nSo in total, it has 900+495=<<900+495=1395>>1395 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 1395+900=<<1395+900=2295>>2295 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 2295*5=<<2295*5=11,475>>11,475 apartments every week\nSo he makes 11,475*£0.45=£<<11,475*0.45=5163>>5163 every week\n#### 5163", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
