{"question": "Alex goes to the store to buy some sugar. The normal brand of sugar he buys costs £24 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses 2 kg of sugar per day. He also decided to buy himself a cookie for £5. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The sugar he bought was 24*0.2=£<<24*0.2=4>>4 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 24+4=£<<24+4=28>>28 per kg\nHe goes through 2*7=<<2*7=14>>14 kgs of sugar a week\nSo he paid 28.8*14=£<<28.8*14=403>>403 on sugar\nThat means his total bill was 403+5=£<<403+5=408>>408\n#### 408", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
