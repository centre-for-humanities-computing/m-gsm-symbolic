{"question": "Ellen can run four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is one quarter as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?", "answer": "If Ellen can skip at one quarter the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is four times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 12/4=3 miles per hour.\nIf two thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*2/3=<<6*2/3=4>>4 hours.\nIf one third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 12 miles per hour, or 2*12=<<2*12=24>>24 miles.\nShe walks for 4 hours at 3 miles per hour, or 4*3=<<4*3=12>>12 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 24+12=<<24+12=36>>36 miles.\n#### 36", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
