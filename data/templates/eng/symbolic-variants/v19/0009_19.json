The tower of stacking rings has 34 multicolored rings on it. Claire recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her brother up to 139. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Claire has 34 + 45 + 34 + T = 113 + T = 139 toys for her brother.\nThus, T = 139 - 113 = <<139-113=26>>26 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 26", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
