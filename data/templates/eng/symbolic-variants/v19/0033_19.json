{"question": "Madison and Jessica are sisters from Chicago who love collecting signatures from movie stars. During their fall break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 8 weeks, Madison and Jessica compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Madison has 19 signatures in her book, and Jessica has 44. The sisters have 2 more weeks of fall break, and they decide they want to reach 95 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Madison and Jessica have already collected 19 + 44 signatures = <<19+44=63>>63 signatures.\nSince their goal is 95, they need to collect 95 - 63 signatures. 95 - 63 = <<95-63=32>>32 signatures\n#### 32", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
