{"question": "Carl is feeding his livestock grain. Each goat needs 14 kg, and each alpaca needs 9 kg less than twice the amount each goat needs. If there are 20 goats and 16 alpacas, how many kg of grain does Carl need?", "answer": "First figure out how much grain each alpaca needs: 14 kg * 2 - 9 = <<14*2-9=19>>19 kg/alpaca\nNow figure out how much grain total the alpacas need: 19 kg/alpaca * 16 alpacas = <<19*16=304>>304 kg\nNow figure out how much grain total the goats need: 14 kg/goat * 20 goats = <<14*20=280>>280 kg\nNow add the two amounts of grain to find the total: 304 kg + 280 kg = <<304+280=584>>584 kg\n#### 584", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
