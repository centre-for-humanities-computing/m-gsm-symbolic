{"question": "In Mr. Smith's class of 92 students, 28% of the class are swimmers. Out of the remaining class, 42% of the students are debate team members or part of robotics club members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away performance. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "28% of the 92 student class are swimmers so that's 0.28*92 = <<0.28*92=25>>25 students\nThere are 92 students and 25 are swimmers so that leaves 92-25 = <<92-25=67>>67 students\n42% of the remaining 67 students are part of robotics club members or debate team members so that's 0.42*67 = <<0.42*67=28>>28 students\n25 students are swimmers and 28 are part of robotics club members/debate team members so 25+28 = <<25+28=53>>53 students will be leaving early\n#### 53", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
