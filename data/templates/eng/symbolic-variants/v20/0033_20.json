{"question": "Ava and Emily are sisters from Phoenix who love collecting signatures from politicians. During their winter break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 7 weeks, Ava and Emily compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Ava has 35 signatures in her book, and Emily has 54. The sisters have 5 more weeks of winter break, and they decide they want to reach 115 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Ava and Emily have already collected 35 + 54 signatures = <<35+54=89>>89 signatures.\nSince their goal is 115, they need to collect 115 - 89 signatures. 115 - 89 = <<115-89=26>>26 signatures\n#### 26", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
