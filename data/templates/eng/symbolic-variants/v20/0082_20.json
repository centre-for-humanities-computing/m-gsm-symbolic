{"question": "At the beginning of the conference, there were 55 engineers and 17 lawyers. After half an hour, 1/8 of the total number of people left. How many lawyers are left if 28 engineers stayed at the conference?", "answer": "There were a total of 55 engineers + 17 lawyers = <<55+17=72>>72 people who attended the conference.\nAfter half an hour, 72 people * 1/8 = <<72*1/8=9>>9 people left the conference.\nThis means 72 people - 9 people = <<72-9=63>>63 people stayed.\nOut of the 63 who stayed, 63 people - 28 engineers = <<63-28=35>>35 were lawyers.\n#### 35", "id_orig": 320, "id_shuffled": 82}
