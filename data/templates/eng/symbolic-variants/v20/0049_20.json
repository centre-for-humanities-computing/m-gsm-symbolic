{"question": "Kenneth collects garbage from 4 different apartment complexes. The first three have 400 apartments each and the last one is 20% bigger than the other three combined. He collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid £0.4 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first three complexes have 3*400=<<3*400=1200>>1200 apartments\nNumber 4 has 1200*0.2=<<1200*0.2=240>>240 more apartments than those three combined.\nSo in total, it has 1200+240=<<1200+240=1440>>1440 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 1440+1200=<<1440+1200=2640>>2640 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 2640*5=<<2640*5=13,200>>13,200 apartments every week\nSo he makes 13,200*£0.4=£<<13,200*0.4=5280>>5280 every week\n#### 5280", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
