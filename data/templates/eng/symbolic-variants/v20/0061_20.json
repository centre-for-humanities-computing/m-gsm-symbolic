{"question": "Henry has a bag of marbles with 90 inside. He tripped over a toy while carrying it and dropped one third of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 15. When he went back home, he inspected the marbles further. Five of the ones he picked up weren't marbles, but actually coins so he got rid of them. How many marbles did Henry end up with?", "answer": "Henry dropped his marbles and was left with 90*2/3=<<90*2/3=60>>60 marbles.\nHe searched and found some of his lost marbles, getting him back to 60+15=<<60+15=75>>75 marbles.\nHe went home and removed five coins, leaving him with 75-5=<<75-5=70>>70 marbles.\n#### 70", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
