{"question": "Carl watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Thursday and Friday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Saturday, he watched a few episodes of a 60-minute show. On Sunday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 15-minute show. On Monday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 3-hour episodes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Saturday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Saturday.\nAfter Thursday, he had 20 - 1 = <<20-1=19>>19 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 19 - 1 = <<19-1=18>>18 hours of TV left.\nAfter Sunday, he had 18 - 3 - 0.25 = 14.75 hours of TV left.\nAfter Monday, he had 14.75 - 12 = 2.75 hours of TV left.\nEach 60-minute episode is 1 hour.\nThus, E = 2.75/1 = 2.75 episodes.\n#### 2.75", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
