{"question": "Claire is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a cardigan, beanie, sweater, mittens, and booties for each of them. It takes 10 skeins of wool to make a cardigan, 9 for a beanie, 14 for a sweater, 12 for a pair of mittens, and 11 for a pair of booties. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 10 skeins per cardigan + 9 skeins per beanie + 14 skeins per sweater + 12 skeins per pair of mittens + 11 skeins per pair of booties = <<10+9+14+12+11=56>>56 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3*56 = <<3*56=168>>168 skeins of wool.\n#### 168", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
