{"question": "The vending machines sell cookies for 60 cents and pretzels for 105 cents. Lucas spent €12 and got 5 bags of cookies and had 5% of his money left in change. How many pretzels did he buy?", "answer": "Lucas got €0.6 in change because €12*5/100 = <<12*5/100=0.6>>0.6\nLucas spent €11.4 because 12 - 0.6 = <<12-0.6=11.4>>11.4\nLucas spent €3 on cookies because 5*0.6 = <<5*0.6=3>>3\nLucas spent 8.4 on pretzels because 11.4 - 3 = <<11.4-3=8.4>>8.4\nLucas bought 8 pretzels because 8.4 / 1.05 = <<8=8>>8\n#### 8", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
