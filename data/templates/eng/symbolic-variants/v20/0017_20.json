{"question": "Ellen walks 30 feets every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 16 feets of walking on the beach and 14 feet(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Ellen walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 30-feet walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Ellen walks at a rate of 16 feets per 64 minutes, or 16/64 = 1/4 feets per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/4 = 0.5 feets per minute.\nTo walk 14 feet(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 14/0.5 = <<14/0.5=28>>28 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Ellen 64+28 = <<64+28=92>>92 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 92", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
