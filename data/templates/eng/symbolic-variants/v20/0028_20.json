{"question": "A hospital has a capacity of 1900 beds with 1/4 occupied. Due to the natural disaster, 55 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/4 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/4 * 1900 = <<1900*1/4=475>>475 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1900 beds - 475 beds = <<1900-475=1425>>1425 beds.\nIf 55 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 55 patients/day * 7 days/week = 385 patients.\nAfter 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 385 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<385*2=770>>770 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 1425 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1425 beds - 770 beds = <<1425-770=655>>655 unoccupied beds.\n#### 655", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
