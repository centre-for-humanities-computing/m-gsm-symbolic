On Thursday, he sold 12 more boxes of gingerbread than on Wednesday and 23 boxes of grapes pie. If the gingerbread cost €8 and the grapes pie cost €27, how much did Henry earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 25 + 12 = <<25+12=37>>37 boxes of gingerbread on Thursday.\nThe total number of boxes of gingerbread that Henry sold is 25 + 37 = <<25+37=62>>62.\nHenry earned 62*€8 = €<<62*8=496>>496 for selling gingerbread.\nHe sold 23 - 18 = <<23-18=5>>5 boxes of grapes pie on Wednesday.\nThe total number of boxes of grapes pie that Henry sold is 23 + 5 = <<23+5=28>>28.\nHe earned 28*€27 = €<<28*27=756>>756 for selling grapes pie.\nSo, Henry earned €496 + €756 = €<<496+756=1252>>1252 for two days.\n#### 1252", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
