{"question": "William hires a boat from 7 PM to 11 PM. He gets 1 hour(s) free. The first paid hour is $22 and each hour after that is twice the cost. How much did he pay?", "answer": "He got it for 11-7=<<11-7=4>>4 hours\nHe pays for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours\nThe first hour cost 1*22=$<<1*22=22>>22\nThe other 3-1=2 hours are more expensive\nThey cost 22*2=$<<22*2=44>>44 per hour\nSo those 2 hours cost 2*44=$<<2*44=88>>88\nSo he pays 88+22=$<<88+22=110>>110 in total\n#### 110", "id_orig": 652, "id_shuffled": 89}
