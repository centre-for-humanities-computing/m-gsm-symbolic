If he also paid $530,000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment, how much is Dr. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the apartment?", "answer": "Dr. Johnson paid $840,000*2/100 = $16,800 for the transfer fees.\nHe paid $840,000*4/100 = $33,600 for the realtor fee.\nSo, Dr. Johnson paid a total of $16,800 + $33,600 + $530,000 = $580,400 for the transfer, realtor, and loan fees.\nHence, Dr. Johnson's net proceeds is $840,000 - $580,400 = $259,600.\n#### 259,600", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
