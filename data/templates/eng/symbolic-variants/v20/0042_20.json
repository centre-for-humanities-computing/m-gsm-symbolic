{"question": "Eric goes to the store to buy some flour. The normal brand of flour he buys costs €3 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 30% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 2 kg of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for €5. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The flour he bought was 3*0.3=€<<3*0.3=0>>0 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 3+0=€<<3+0=3>>3 per kg\nHe goes through 2*7=<<2*7=14>>14 kgs of flour a week\nSo he paid 3.9*14=€<<3.9*14=54>>54 on flour\nThat means his total bill was 54+5=€<<54+5=59>>59\n#### 59", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
