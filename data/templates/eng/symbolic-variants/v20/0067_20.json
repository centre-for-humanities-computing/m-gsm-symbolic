{"question": "Alex's SUV breaks down. The SUV weighs 2850 pounds and he has equipment in it weighing 175 pounds. He also has his four young children who weigh 75 pounds each in it. If the force to move the SUV is 3% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the SUV?", "answer": "His four children weigh 75*4=<<75*4=300>>300 pounds\nSo the total weight of the SUV and everything is 2850+175+300=<<2850+175+300=3325>>3325 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 3325*0.03=<<3325*0.03=99>>99 pounds\n#### 99", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
