{"question": "One troll can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe and 35% more with a mithril pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe. How many kgs of ore can 25 trolls with mithril pickaxes mine in a month with 29 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a troll can mine with an bronze pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 kgs/day\nThen multiply that amount by 135% to find how much a troll can mine with a mithril pickaxe: 10 kgs/day * 135% = <<10*135*.01=13>>13 kgs/day\nThen multiply the amount one troll can mine in a day with a mithril pickaxe by the number of trolls: 13 kgs/day/troll * 25 trolls = <<13*25=337>>337 kgs/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 337 kgs/day * 29 days = <<337*29=9787>>9787 kgs/day\n#### 9787", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
