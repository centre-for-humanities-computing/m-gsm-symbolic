{"question": "To make a call from a phone booth, you must pay £0.75 for each minute of your call. After 41 minutes, that price drops to £0.5 per minute. How much would a 87-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 41 minutes would be a cost of 41 * 0.75 = £<<41*0.75=30>>30.\nAfter that, there are 87 - 41 = <<87-41=46>>46 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 46 minutes cost 46 * 0.5 = £<<46*0.5=23>>23.\nSo in total, the 87-minute call would cost 30 + 23 = £53.\n#### 53", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
