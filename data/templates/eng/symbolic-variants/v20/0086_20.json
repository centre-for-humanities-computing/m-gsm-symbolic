{"question": "Olivia qualified for a spot on the soccer team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a jersey for €21, a pair of soccer shorts for €9 more than the jersey cost, and a pair of cleats that were originally €48 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for €4 off the package of €14 athletic headbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The shorts were €9 more than the jersey, so they cost €9 + €21 = €<<9+21=30>>30.\nHer cleats were half the original €48 price, so they cost €48*1/2=€24.\nWith her coupon, the headbands were €14 - €4 = €<<14-4=10>>10.\nThe jersey, shorts, cleats, and headbands together cost €21 + €30 + €24 + €10 = €<<21+30+24+10=85>>85.\n#### 85", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
