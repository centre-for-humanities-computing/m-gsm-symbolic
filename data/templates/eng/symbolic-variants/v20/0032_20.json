{"question": "Mrs. Smith is looking for a apartment that will not go beyond her $460,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $440,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 6% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the apartment than Mrs. Smith's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $440,000*6/100 = $<<440,000*6/100=26,400>>26,400.\nThe transfer fee is $440,000*12/100 = $<<440,000*12/100=52,800>>52,800.\nThe total price of the apartment is $440,000 + $26,400 + $52,800 = $519,200.\nSo, it is $519,200 - $460,000 = $<<519,200-460,000=59,200>>59,200 more than Mrs. Smith's budget.\n#### 59,200", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
