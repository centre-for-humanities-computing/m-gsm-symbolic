{"question": "A bacteria infects six people. Every day, each infected person infects five others. How many people are infected after three days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original six people infect five people each, so 6*5 = <<6*5=30>>30 more people are infected.\nThere are 6+30 = <<6+30=36>>36 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 36*5 = <<36*5=180>>180 more people are infected.\nThere are 36 + 180 = <<36+180=216>>216 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 216*5 = 1080 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 216 + 1080 = 1296 infected people after three days.\n#### 1296", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
