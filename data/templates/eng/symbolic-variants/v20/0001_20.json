{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 232 minutes to cover every 6 miles of the city. If the city is 58 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 58/6 = <<58/6=9>>9 intervals of 232 minutes.\nThus, it will take 9 * 232 = <<9*232=2088>>2088 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 2088", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
