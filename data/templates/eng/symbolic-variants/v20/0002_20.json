{"question": "David is rolling a 20-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?", "answer": "There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 10/20=50%.\nThe chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.\nThe difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.\n#### 25", "id_orig": 184, "id_shuffled": 2}
