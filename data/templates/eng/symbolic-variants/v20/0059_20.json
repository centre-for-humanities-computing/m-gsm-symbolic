{"question": "I have 11 liters of apple drink that are three fifths water and I wish to add it to 30 liters of lemon drink that is one third water. But as I pour it, I spill six liters of the apple drink. How much water is in the remaining 35 liters?", "answer": "There are 30*1/3 = <<30*1/3=10>>10 liters of water from the 30 liters lemon drink.\nAfter six liters of apple drink was spilled, there were 11-6 = <<11-6=5>>5 liters of apple drink left.\nOut of the 5 liters, 5*3/5 = <<5*3/5=3>>3 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 10 + 3 = <<10+3=13>>13 liters of water out of the 35 liters.\n#### 13", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
