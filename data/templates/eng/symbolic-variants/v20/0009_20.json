{"question": "When Ellen watches her brother, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 62 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 28 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 29 multicolored rings on it. Ellen recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her brother up to 184. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Ellen has 62 + 28 + 29 + T = 119 + T = 184 toys for her brother.\nThus, T = 184 - 119 = <<184-119=65>>65 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 65", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
