{"question": "Ethan caught 5 steelheads last Saturday, the first steelhead he caught weighs 48 kilograms, the second steelhead he caught weighs 30 kilograms, and the remaining steelhead he caught weighs 30 kilograms. If a kilogram of steelhead costs €1.75, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?", "answer": "Ethan will earn 48*€1.75 = €<<48*1.75=84>>84 from the first steelhead.\nHe will earn 30*€1.75 = €<<30*1.75=52.5>>52.5 for the second steelhead.\nThe rest of the steelheads are 5-2 = <<5-2=3>>3. He will earn 30*€1.75 = €<<30*1.75=52.5>>52.5 per each of them. So he will earn 3 * 52.5 = <<3*52.5>>=157.5\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the steelheads is €84 + €52.5 + €157.5= €<<84+52.5+157.5=293>>294.\n#### 294", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
