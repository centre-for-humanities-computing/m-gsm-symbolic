{"question": "At Joe's house, there are thrice as many bananas as corns. He has a total of 84 corns in his house. Joe bought 35 more corns at the store and 19 fewer bananas than the number of corns. Find the combined total of the number of bananas and corns Joe has in the house?", "answer": "Before buying any banana and corn, Joe had thrice as many bananas as corns, which is 84 corns*3 banana/corn = <<84*3=252>>252 bananas\nThe total number of bananas and corns that Joe had before is 252 bananas + 84 corns = <<252+84=336>>336 items\nWhen he bought 19 fewer bananas than corns, he bought 35 bananas - 19 bananas = <<35-19=16>>16 bananas\nIn total, he bought 16 bananas + 35 corns = <<16+35=51>>51 items\nAfter the purchases, Joe has 336 items + 51 items = <<336+51=387>>387 total bananas and corns combined.\n#### 387", "id_orig": 406, "id_shuffled": 91}
