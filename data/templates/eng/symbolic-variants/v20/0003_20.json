{"question": "A class of 145 students has various hobbies. 74 like to dance, 13 like to play tennis, and the rest like to either read or bake. How many like to read if the number that like to bake is twice the number that prefer playing tennis?", "answer": "The number of students that like to bake is twice as many as the number who like tennis, so 2 * 13 = <<2*13=26>>26\nThe number that like to read is 145 total students - 74 that like to dance - 13 that like to play tennis - 26 that like to bake = <<145-74-13-26=32>>32\n#### 32", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
