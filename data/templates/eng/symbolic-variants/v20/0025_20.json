{"question": "In Mr. Smith's class of 29 students, 33% of the class are swimmers. Out of the remaining class, 40% of the students are choir members or part of robotics club members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away meet. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "33% of the 29 student class are swimmers so that's 0.33*29 = <<0.33*29=9>>9 students\nThere are 29 students and 9 are swimmers so that leaves 29-9 = <<29-9=20>>20 students\n40% of the remaining 20 students are part of robotics club members or choir members so that's 0.4*20 = <<0.4*20=8>>8 students\n9 students are swimmers and 8 are part of robotics club members/choir members so 9+8 = <<9+8=17>>17 students will be leaving early\n#### 17", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
