{"question": "Amanda is popping popcorn for a snack. As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 40 pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to six times the initial popping rate in the next 30 seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Amanda takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Amanda have to eat?", "answer": "In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3*40=<<3*40=120>>120 kernels pop.\nIn the third 30 seconds, 6*40=<<6*40=240>>240 kernels pop.\nIn the final 30 seconds, 240 / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 kernels pop.\nAfter cooking, the residual heat makes 120 / 4 = <<120/4=30>>30 kernels pop.\nThus, Amanda has 40 + 120 + 240 + 120 + 30 = <<40+120+240+120+30=550>>550 pieces of popcorn to eat.\n#### 550", "id_orig": 1264, "id_shuffled": 4}
