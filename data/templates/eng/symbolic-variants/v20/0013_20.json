{"question": "Isabella is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 23 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 4 potted plants on each of the 62 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 2 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Isabella remain with?", "answer": "Two days ago, before receiving the plants, Isabella had 4*62 = <<4*62=248>>248 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 23 plants, she therefore had a total of 248 + 23 = <<248+23=271>>271 potted plants\nTomorrow, Isabellas plant giveaway will be 62*2 = <<62*2=124>>124 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 271 - 124 = <<271-124=147>>147 potted plants.\n#### 147", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
