{"question": "Matt wants to make different sized ice cubes with 144 lbs of water. He can make giant cubes that use 6 lbs per cube, medium cubes that use 2 lbs, and small cubes that use 1/5 lb. If he makes 4 giant cubes, 11 medium cubes, and 15 small cubes, how many lbs of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 24 lbs of water because 4 times 6 equals <<4*6=24>>24.\nThe medium cubes used up 22 lbs of water because 11 times 2 equals <<11*2=22>>22.\nThe small cubes used up 3 lbs of water because 15 times 1/5 equals 3.\nThis means that Matt has used up 49 lbs of water because 24 plus 22 plus 3 equals 49.\nMatt has 95 lbs of water left because 144 minus 49 equals <<144-49=95>>95.\n#### 95", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
