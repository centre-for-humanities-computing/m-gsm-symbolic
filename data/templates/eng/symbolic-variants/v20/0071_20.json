{"question": "Michael is feeding his livestock feed. Each cow needs 4 kg, and each alpaca needs 3 kg less than twice the amount each cow needs. If there are 48 cows and 27 alpacas, how many kg of feed does Michael need?", "answer": "First figure out how much feed each alpaca needs: 4 kg * 2 - 3 = <<4*2-3=5>>5 kg/alpaca\nNow figure out how much feed total the alpacas need: 5 kg/alpaca * 27 alpacas = <<5*27=135>>135 kg\nNow figure out how much feed total the cows need: 4 kg/cow * 48 cows = <<4*48=192>>192 kg\nNow add the two amounts of feed to find the total: 135 kg + 192 kg = <<135+192=327>>327 kg\n#### 327", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
