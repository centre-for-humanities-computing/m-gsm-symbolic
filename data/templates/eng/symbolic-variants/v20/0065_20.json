{"question": "Emma is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire one financial advisor. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of consulting work, losing €69/hour in missed income. The financial advisor charges €182. How much more money will she have if she hires the financial advisor?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Emma does her taxes herself: €69/hour * 3 hours = €<<69*3=207>>207\nThen subtract the financial advisor's charge to find how much money Emma saves: €207 - €182 = €<<207-182=25>>25\n#### 25", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
