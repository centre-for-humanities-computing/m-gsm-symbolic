{"question": "Ashley is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the arabic abjad (with 28 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Ashley written in total?", "answer": "Ashley has written the arabic abjad (with 28 letters) twice which is a total of 28*2=<<28*2=56>>56 letters.\nShe then writes half the arabic abjad (with 28 letters), which is 28*1/2=<<28*1/2=14>>14 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 56 + 14 = <<56+14=70>>70 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 70 * 2 = <<70*2=140>>140 letters.\n#### 140", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
