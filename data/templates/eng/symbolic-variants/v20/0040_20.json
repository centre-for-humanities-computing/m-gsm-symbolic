{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $14 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $1 per pound, get 1 pound 1/3 off.\" She scooped up 3 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $2.0 and 10 magnets that were $0.0 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $1 and gets 1 pound 1/3 off. So 1/3 off of 1 pound is $1*1/3 = $0.3333333333333333. The rest of 1 pound does not have discount and costs 1*$1 = $1, so total is $1+$2/3+$1=$8/3\n10 magnets at $0 each is 10*0=$<<10*0=0>>0\nWhen you add all her purchases, 8/3+$2+$0 = $<<8/3+2+0=4>>4\nShe had $14 and spent $4 so she had $14-$4 = $<<14-4=10>>10 left over\n#### 10", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
