{"question": "Anna saw a 250-foot dolphin with 3 40-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 40 inches/remora * 3 remoras = <<40*3=120>>120 inches.\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 120 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<120/12=10>>10 foot.\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 10 foot / 250 feet * 100% = 4%\n\n#### 4", "id_orig": 473, "id_shuffled": 0}
