{"question": "Henry went to buy some school supplies. He bought 20 notebooks which cost $3.0 each, 10 crayons which cost $18.5 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost $11. How much did Henry spend on everything?", "answer": "Henry spent 20*$3 = $<<20*3=60>>60 for the notebooks.\nHe also spent 10*$18.5 = $<<10*18.5=185>>185 for the crayons.\nTherefore, Henry spent a total of $60 + $185 + $11 = $<<60+185+11=256>>256 for the school supplies.\n#### 256", "id_orig": 158, "id_shuffled": 18}
