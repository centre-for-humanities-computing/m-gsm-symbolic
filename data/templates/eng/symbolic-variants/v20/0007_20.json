{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of wheats, oats, carrots and hay. Since hay are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pounds boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pounds bags. Wheats are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys forty 55-pounds packs. Oats are a staple to supplement the wheats, so he buys fifteen 50-pounds sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1500 poundss at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 poundss of hay.\nHe is buying 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 poundss of carrots.\nHe is buying 15*50 = <<15*50=750>>750 poundss of oats.\nHe is buying 40*55 = <<40*55=2200>>2200 poundss of wheats.\nThe weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 750 + 2200 = <<2+48+750+2200=3000>>3000 poundss.\nThus, the farmer needs 3000 / 1500 = <<3000/1500=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
