{"question": "If Abby and Oliver have 220 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Oliver getting 190 yards more than Abby, how much is left over for Abby?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Abby gets and y be the amount Oliver gets. We know that y = x + 190, and y + x = 220.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+190=220\nSubtracting the 190 from both sides, we get 2x=30\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=15. This means Abby has 15 yards of fence left over.\n#### 15", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
