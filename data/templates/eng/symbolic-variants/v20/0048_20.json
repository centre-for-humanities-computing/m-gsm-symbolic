{"question": "Anna can peel 12 clams a minute and saute 20 clams in 19 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 clams?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Anna to peel the clams: 60 clams / 12 clams/minute = <<60/12=5>>5 minutes\nThen find how many batches of clams she needs to cook: 60 clams / 20 clams/batch = <<60/20=3>>3 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 19 minutes/batch = <<3*19=57>>57 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Anna spends: 57 minutes + 5 minutes = <<57+5=62>>62 minutes\n#### 62", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
