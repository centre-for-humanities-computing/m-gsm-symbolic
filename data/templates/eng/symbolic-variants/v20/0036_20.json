{"question": "Emily went to the cafe and bought various types of pastries. She bought 5 dozen croissants which cost $21 per dozen, 10 dozen tarts which cost $88 per dozen, and 8 dozen brownies for $119 per dozen. How much was the total cost?", "answer": "The total charge for the croissants was 5*$21 = $<<5*21=105>>105.\nThe total charge for the tarts was 10*$88 = $<<10*88=880>>880.\nThe total charge for the brownies was 8*$119 = $<<8*119=952>>952.\nTherefore the total amount Emily paid for the pastries was $105 + $880 + $952 = $<<105+880+952=1937>>1937.\n#### 1937", "id_orig": 11, "id_shuffled": 36}
