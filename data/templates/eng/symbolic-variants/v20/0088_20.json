{"question": "Jessica can run thrice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is one third as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends two thirds of the time running and one third of the time walking?", "answer": "If Jessica can skip at one third the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is thrice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 9/3=3 miles per hour.\nIf one third of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*1/3=<<6*1/3=2>>2 hours.\nIf two thirds of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 hours.\nThus, she runs for 4 hours at 9 miles per hour, or 4*9=<<4*9=36>>36 miles.\nShe walks for 2 hours at 3 miles per hour, or 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 36+6=<<36+6=42>>42 miles.\n#### 42", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
