{"question": "Ellen buys 16 shares of a stock for £11 each. The stock price increases 55% the first year Ellen holds it, then decreases 25% in the second year. What is the final value of all Ellen's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Ellen's purchase: 16 shares * £11/share = £<<16*11=176>>176\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: £176 * 0.55 = £<<176*0.55=96.8>>96\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: £176 + £96.8 = £<<176+96.8=272.8>>272\nThen multiply that amount by 25% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: £272.8 * 25% = £<<272.8*25*.01=68.2>>68\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: £272 - £68 = £<<272-68=204>>204\n#### 204", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
