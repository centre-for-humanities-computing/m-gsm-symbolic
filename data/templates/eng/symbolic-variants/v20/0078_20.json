{"question": "There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Joshua has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. He goes to class for 5 days a week. He then spends 1/3 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 6+3=<<6+3=9>>9 classes a day\nThat means he spends 40*9=<<40*9=360>>360 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 360*5=<<360*5=1800>>1800 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1800*1/3=<<1800*1/3=600>>600 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 1800+600+600=<<1800+600+600=3000>>3000 minutes per week\nSo he spends 3000/60=<<3000/60=50>>50 hours per week\n#### 50", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
