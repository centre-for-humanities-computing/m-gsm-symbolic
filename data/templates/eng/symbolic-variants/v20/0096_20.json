{"question": "Lily's uncle said that she had £220 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of bowling, have £3 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the bumper cars thrice. A round of bowling is £4. The bumper cars cost £5 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The bumper cars will cost £15 per person because 5*3 = <<5*3=15>>15\nEach person costs £22 because 3 + 4 + 15 = <<3+4+15=22>>22\n10 total people can attend because 220 / 22 = <<220/22=10>>10\nShe can invite 9 friends because 10 - 1 =<<10-1=9>>9\n#### 9", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
