{"question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 350 calories per serving. If a 300 ounces bag has 4 servings, how many ouncess can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2250 and you have already consumed 1200 calories?", "answer": "If the total calorie target is 2250 and I have consumed 1200 calories then I have 2250-1200 = <<2250-1200=1050>>1050 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of popcorn has 350 calories and I only have 1050 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 1050/350 of a serving = 3 of a serving\nWe also know that a 300 ounces bag of popcorn has 4 servings, hence each serving has 300 ounces/4 = <<300/4=75>>75 ouncess\nIf I can only eat 3 of a serving, then I can eat only 75 ounces * 3 = 225 ouncess\n#### 225", "id_orig": 43, "id_shuffled": 24}
