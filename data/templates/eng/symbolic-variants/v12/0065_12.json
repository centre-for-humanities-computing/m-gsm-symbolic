{"question": "Madison is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire one bookkeeper. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 9 fewer hours of contract work, losing £99/hour in missed income. The bookkeeper charges £182. How much more money will she have if she hires the bookkeeper?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Madison does her taxes herself: £99/hour * 9 hours = £<<99*9=891>>891\nThen subtract the bookkeeper's charge to find how much money Madison saves: £891 - £182 = £<<891-182=709>>709\n#### 709", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
