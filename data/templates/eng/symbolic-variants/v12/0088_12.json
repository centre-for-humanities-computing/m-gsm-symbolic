{"question": "Laura can run thrice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is two thirds as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 4 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in ten hours if she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking?", "answer": "If Laura can skip at two thirds the speed she can run, then she can run at 4*3/2=<<4*3/2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is thrice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/3=2 miles per hour.\nIf half of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 10*1/2=<<10*1/2=5>>5 hours.\nIf half of the time is spent running, then she runs for 10-5=<<10-5=5>>5 hours.\nThus, she runs for 5 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 5*6=<<5*6=30>>30 miles.\nShe walks for 5 hours at 2 miles per hour, or 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 30+10=<<30+10=40>>40 miles.\n#### 40", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
