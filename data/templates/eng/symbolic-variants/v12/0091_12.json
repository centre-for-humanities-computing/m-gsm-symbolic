{"question": "At Chris's house, there are five times as many figs as oranges. He has a total of 35 oranges in his house.

Find the combined total of the number of figs and oranges Chris has in the house?", "answer": "Before buying any fig and orange, Chris had five times as many figs as oranges, which is 35 oranges*5 fig/orange = <<35*5=175>>175 figs\nThe total number of figs and oranges that Chris had before is 175 figs + 35 oranges = <<175+35=210>>210 items\nWhen he bought 19 fewer figs than oranges, he bought 95 figs - 19 figs = <<95-19=76>>76 figs\nIn total, he bought 76 figs + 95 oranges = <<76+95=171>>171 items\nAfter the purchases, Chris has 210 items + 171 items = <<210+171=381>>381 total figs and oranges combined.\n#### 381", "id_orig": 406, "id_shuffled": 91}
