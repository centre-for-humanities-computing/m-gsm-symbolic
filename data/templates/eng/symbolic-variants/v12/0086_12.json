{"question": "Andrea qualified for a spot on the basketball team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a t-shirt for $8, a pair of basketball leggings for $13 more than the t-shirt cost, and a pair of athletic shoes that were originally $38 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for $2 off the package of $11 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The leggings were $13 more than the t-shirt, so they cost $13 + $8 = $<<13+8=21>>21.\nHer athletic shoes were half the original $38 price, so they cost $38*1/2=$19.\nWith her coupon, the socks were $11 - $2 = $<<11-2=9>>9.\nThe t-shirt, leggings, athletic shoes, and socks together cost $8 + $21 + $19 + $9 = $<<8+21+19+9=57>>57.\n#### 57", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
