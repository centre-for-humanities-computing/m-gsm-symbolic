{"question": "Emma is an avid gardener. Last night, she received 30 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 10 potted plants on each of the 55 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 3 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Emma remain with?", "answer": "Last night, before receiving the plants, Emma had 10*55 = <<10*55=550>>550 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 30 plants, she therefore had a total of 550 + 30 = <<550+30=580>>580 potted plants\nTomorrow, Emmas plant giveaway will be 55*3 = <<55*3=165>>165 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 580 - 165 = <<580-165=415>>415 potted plants.\n#### 415", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
