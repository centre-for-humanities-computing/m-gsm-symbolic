{"question": "Chris goes to the store to buy some flour. The normal brand of flour he buys costs €19 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 25% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 1 kilogram of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for €1. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The flour he bought was 19*0.25=€<<19*0.25=4>>4 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 19+4=€<<19+4=23>>23 per kilogram\nHe goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kilograms of flour a week\nSo he paid 23.75*7=€<<23.75*7=166>>166 on flour\nThat means his total bill was 166+1=€<<166+1=167>>167\n#### 167", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
