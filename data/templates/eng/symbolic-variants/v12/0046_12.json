{"question": "Riverside Academy is holding graduation in their Auditorium this year which has space for 6200 people. After accounting for 1250 seats for graduates and 150 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?", "answer": "Add graduate and faculty seats together. 1250 + 150 = <<1250+150=1400>>1400 seats for faculty and graduates\nMinus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6200 - 1400 = <<6200-1400=4800>>4800 remaining seats.\nDivide remaining seats by the number of graduates. 4800/1250 = <<4800/1250=3>>3 tickets\n#### 3", "id_orig": 1031, "id_shuffled": 46}
