{"question": "Olivia buys 7 shares of a stock for £60 each. The stock price increases 50% the first year Olivia holds it, then decreases 15% in the second year. What is the final value of all Olivia's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Olivia's purchase: 7 shares * £60/share = £<<7*60=420>>420\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: £420 * 0.5 = £<<420*0.5=210>>210\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: £420 + £210 = £<<420+210=630>>630\nThen multiply that amount by 15% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: £630 * 15% = £<<630*15*.01=94.5>>94\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: £630 - £94 = £<<630-94=535>>535\n#### 535", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
