{"question": "Joe has a bag of beads with 50 inside. He tripped over a rock while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 14. When he went back home, he inspected the beads further. Seven of the ones he picked up weren't beads, but actually pebbles so he got rid of them. How many beads did Joe end up with?", "answer": "Joe dropped his beads and was left with 50*1/2=<<50*1/2=25>>25 beads.\nHe searched and found some of his lost beads, getting him back to 25+14=<<25+14=39>>39 beads.\nHe went home and removed seven pebbles, leaving him with 39-7=<<39-7=32>>32 beads.\n#### 32", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
