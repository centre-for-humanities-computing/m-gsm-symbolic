{"question": "If Ashley and Henry have 920 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Henry getting 20 feet more than Ashley, how much is left over for Ashley?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Ashley gets and y be the amount Henry gets. We know that y = x + 20, and y + x = 920.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+20=920\nSubtracting the 20 from both sides, we get 2x=900\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=450. This means Ashley has 450 feet of fence left over.\n#### 450", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
