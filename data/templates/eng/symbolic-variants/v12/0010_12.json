{"question": "To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay £0.5 for each minute of your call. After 10 minutes, that price drops to £0.2 per minute. How much would a 43-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 10 minutes would be a cost of 10 * 0.5 = £<<10*0.5=5>>5.\nAfter that, there are 43 - 10 = <<43-10=33>>33 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 33 minutes cost 33 * 0.2 = £<<33*0.2=6>>6.\nSo in total, the 43-minute call would cost 5 + 6 = £11.\n#### 11", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
