{"question": "I have 9 liters of peach drink that are one fifth water and I wish to add it to 18 liters of grape drink that is half water. But as I pour it, I spill four liters of the peach drink. How much water is in the remaining 23 liters?", "answer": "There are 18*1/2 = <<18*1/2=9>>9 liters of water from the 18 liters grape drink.\nAfter four liters of peach drink was spilled, there were 9-4 = <<9-4=5>>5 liters of peach drink left.\nOut of the 5 liters, 5*1/5 = <<5*1/5=1>>1 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 9 + 1 = <<9+1=10>>10 liters of water out of the 23 liters.\n#### 10", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
