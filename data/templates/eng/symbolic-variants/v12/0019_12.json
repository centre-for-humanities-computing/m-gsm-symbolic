{"question": "In a 100-item quiz, 50% of the questions are biology, and the rest are equally divided as chemistry and algebra questions. If Isabella is sure to get 60% of the biology questions, and half of the chemistry and algebra questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?", "answer": "The chemistry and algebra questions comprises 100% - 50% = 50% of the quiz.\nThere are 100 questions*50/100 = <<100*50/100=50>>50 biology questions.\nThere are a total of 100 questions*50/100 = <<100*50/100=50>>50 chemistry and algebra questions.\nIf Isabella is sure to get 60% of the biology questions, then this means she is sure of her 50 questions*60/100 = <<50*60/100=30>>30 points.\nFrom the chemistry and algebra questions, she is sure to get half of it correctly so that is 50 questions*1/2 = <<50*1/2=25>>25 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 30 points + 25 points = <<30+25=55>>55 points in her quiz.\n#### 55", "id_orig": 1021, "id_shuffled": 19}
