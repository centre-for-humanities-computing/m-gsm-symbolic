{"question": "Ella and Sarah are sisters from Philadelphia who love collecting signatures from athletes. During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 7 weeks, Ella and Sarah compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Ella has 37 signatures in her book, and Sarah has 34. The sisters have 3 more weeks of summer break, and they decide they want to reach 95 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Ella and Sarah have already collected 37 + 34 signatures = <<37+34=71>>71 signatures.\nSince their goal is 95, they need to collect 95 - 71 signatures. 95 - 71 = <<95-71=24>>24 signatures\n#### 24", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
