{"question": "In Mr. Smith's class of 140 students, 42% of the class are basketball players. Out of the remaining class, 33% of the students are choir members or part of robotics club members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "42% of the 140 student class are basketball players so that's 0.42*140 = <<0.42*140=58>>58 students\nThere are 140 students and 58 are basketball players so that leaves 140-58 = <<140-58=82>>82 students\n33% of the remaining 82 students are part of robotics club members or choir members so that's 0.33*82 = <<0.33*82=27>>27 students\n58 students are basketball players and 27 are part of robotics club members/choir members so 58+27 = <<58+27=85>>85 students will be leaving early\n#### 85", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
