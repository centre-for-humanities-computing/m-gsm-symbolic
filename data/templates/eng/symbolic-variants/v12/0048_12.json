{"question": "Emily can peel 10 clams a minute and saute 45 clams in 7 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 90 clams?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Emily to peel the clams: 90 clams / 10 clams/minute = <<90/10=9>>9 minutes\nThen find how many batches of clams she needs to cook: 90 clams / 45 clams/batch = <<90/45=2>>2 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 2 batches * 7 minutes/batch = <<2*7=14>>14 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 14 minutes + 9 minutes = <<14+9=23>>23 minutes\n#### 23", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
