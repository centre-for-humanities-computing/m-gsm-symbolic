Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 13 plates. How many plates were in the package that Jessica bought?", "answer": "The total number of plates from Jessica and her husband was 13+4=<<13+4=17>>17 plates.\nSince the husband bought a package of 10 plates, then Jessica's package contained 17-10=<<17-10=7>>7 plates.\n#### 7", "id_orig": 125, "id_shuffled": 22}
