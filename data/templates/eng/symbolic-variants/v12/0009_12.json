The tower of stacking rings has 20 multicolored rings on it. Amanda recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her cousin up to 159. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Amanda has 38 + 35 + 20 + T = 93 + T = 159 toys for her cousin.\nThus, T = 159 - 93 = <<159-93=66>>66 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 66", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
