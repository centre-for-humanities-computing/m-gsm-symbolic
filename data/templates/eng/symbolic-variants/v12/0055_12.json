{"question": "Emily is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the hiragana (with 48 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full four times, writes three quarters of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Emily written in total?", "answer": "Emily has written the hiragana (with 48 letters) four times which is a total of 48*4=<<48*4=192>>192 letters.\nShe then writes three quarters the hiragana (with 48 letters), which is 48*3/4=<<48*3/4=36>>36 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 192 + 36 = <<192+36=228>>228 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 228 * 2 = <<228*2=456>>456 letters.\n#### 456", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
