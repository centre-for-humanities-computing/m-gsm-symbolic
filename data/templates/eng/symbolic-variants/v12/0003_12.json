{"question": "A class of 169 students has various hobbies. 27 like to play music, 5 like to play tennis, and the rest like to either paint or bake. How many like to paint if the number that like to bake is twice the number that prefer playing tennis?", "answer": "The number of students that like to bake is twice as many as the number who like tennis, so 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10\nThe number that like to paint is 169 total students - 27 that like to play music - 5 that like to play tennis - 10 that like to bake = <<169-27-5-10=127>>127\n#### 127", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
