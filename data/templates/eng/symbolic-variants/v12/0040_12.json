{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $25 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $3 per pound, get 1 pound 1/10 off.\" She scooped up 3 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $4.0 and 8 magnets that were $0.0 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound 1/10 off. So 1/10 off of 1 pound is $3*1/10 = $0.3. The rest of 1 pound does not have discount and costs 1*$3 = $3, so total is $3+$27/10+$3=$87/10\n8 magnets at $0 each is 8*0=$<<8*0=0>>0\nWhen you add all her purchases, 87/10+$4+$0 = $<<87/10+4+0=12>>12\nShe had $25 and spent $12 so she had $25-$12 = $<<25-12=13>>13 left over\n#### 13", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
