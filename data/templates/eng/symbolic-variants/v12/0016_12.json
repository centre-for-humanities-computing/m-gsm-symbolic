{"question": "Michael is selling muffins and banana pie for a fundraiser. On Thursday, he sold 23 boxes of muffins and 5 fewer boxes of banana pie, than on Friday. On Friday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Thursday and 16 boxes of banana pie. If the muffins cost $8 and the banana pie cost $20, how much did Michael earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 23 + 11 = <<23+11=34>>34 boxes of muffins on Friday.\nThe total number of boxes of muffins that Michael sold is 23 + 34 = <<23+34=57>>57.\nMichael earned 57*$8 = $<<57*8=456>>456 for selling muffins.\nHe sold 16 - 5 = <<16-5=11>>11 boxes of banana pie on Thursday.\nThe total number of boxes of banana pie that Michael sold is 16 + 11 = <<16+11=27>>27.\nHe earned 27*$20 = $<<27*20=540>>540 for selling banana pie.\nSo, Michael earned $456 + $540 = $<<456+540=996>>996 for two days.\n#### 996", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
