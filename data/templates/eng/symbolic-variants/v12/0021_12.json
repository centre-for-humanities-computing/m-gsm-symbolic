{"question": "David watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 2-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 2-hour episodes. If he watched 13 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.\nAfter Monday, he had 13 - 3 = <<13-3=10>>10 hours of TV left.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 10 - 3 = <<10-3=7>>7 hours of TV left.\nAfter Thursday, he had 7 - 2 - 0.5 = 4.5 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 4.5 - 4 = 0.5 hours of TV left.\nEach 15-minute episode is 1/4 hour.\nThus, E = 0.5/0.25 = 2 episodes.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
