{"question": "Carl is feeding his livestock hay. Each llama needs 12 kilograms, and each duck needs 6 kilograms less than twice the amount each llama needs. If there are 42 llamas and 34 ducks, how many kilograms of hay does Carl need?", "answer": "First figure out how much hay each duck needs: 12 kilograms * 2 - 6 = <<12*2-6=18>>18 kilograms/duck\nNow figure out how much hay total the ducks need: 18 kilograms/duck * 34 ducks = <<18*34=612>>612 kilograms\nNow figure out how much hay total the llamas need: 12 kilograms/llama * 42 llamas = <<12*42=504>>504 kilograms\nNow add the two amounts of hay to find the total: 612 kilograms + 504 kilograms = <<612+504=1116>>1116 kilograms\n#### 1116", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
