{"question": "There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Alex has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 45 minutes long. He goes to class for 5 days a week. He then spends 1/4 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day\nThat means he spends 45*8=<<45*8=360>>360 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 360*5=<<360*5=1800>>1800 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1800*1/4=<<1800*1/4=450>>450 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 1800+450+450=<<1800+450+450=2700>>2700 minutes per week\nSo he spends 2700/60=<<2700/60=45>>45 hours per week\n#### 45", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
