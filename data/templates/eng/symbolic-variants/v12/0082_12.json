{"question": "At the beginning of the meeting, there were 45 lawyers and 65 doctors. After an hour, 1/2 of the total number of people left. How many doctors are left if 31 lawyers stayed at the meeting?", "answer": "There were a total of 45 lawyers + 65 doctors = <<45+65=110>>110 people who attended the meeting.\nAfter an hour, 110 people * 1/2 = <<110*1/2=55>>55 people left the meeting.\nThis means 110 people - 55 people = <<110-55=55>>55 people stayed.\nOut of the 55 who stayed, 55 people - 31 lawyers = <<55-31=24>>24 were doctors.\n#### 24", "id_orig": 320, "id_shuffled": 82}
