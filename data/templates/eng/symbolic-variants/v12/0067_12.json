{"question": "Michael's car breaks down. The car weighs 2850 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 375 pounds. He also has his four young teammates who weigh 85 pounds each in it. If the force to move the car is 4% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the car?", "answer": "His four teammates weigh 85*4=<<85*4=340>>340 pounds\nSo the total weight of the car and everything is 2850+375+340=<<2850+375+340=3565>>3565 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 3565*0.04=<<3565*0.04=142>>142 pounds\n#### 142", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
