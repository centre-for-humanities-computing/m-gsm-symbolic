How much was the total cost?", "answer": "The total charge for the danishes was 7*$15 = $<<7*15=105>>105.\nThe total charge for the cookies was 10*$80 = $<<10*80=800>>800.\nThe total charge for the brownies was 4*$118 = $<<4*118=472>>472.\nTherefore the total amount Isabella paid for the baked goods was $105 + $800 + $472 = $<<105+800+472=1377>>1377.\n#### 1377", "id_orig": 11, "id_shuffled": 36}
