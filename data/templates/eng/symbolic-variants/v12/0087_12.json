{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Splash World is 300 yards long, and people slide down at 40 yards/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 260 yards long, but steeper, so people slide down at 90 yards/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 300 yards / 40 yards/minute = <<300/40=7>>7 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 260 yards / 90 yards/minute = <<260/90=2>>2 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 7 minutes - 2 minutes = <<7-2=5>>5 minutes\n#### 5", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
