{"question": "Dr. Patel is looking for a condo that will not go beyond her $350,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $310,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 10% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the condo than Dr. Patel's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $310,000*5/100 = $<<310,000*5/100=15,500>>15,500.\nThe transfer fee is $310,000*10/100 = $<<310,000*10/100=31,000>>31,000.\nThe total price of the condo is $310,000 + $15,500 + $31,000 = $356,500.\nSo, it is $356,500 - $350,000 = $<<356,500-350,000=6500>>6500 more than Dr. Patel's budget.\n#### 6500", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
