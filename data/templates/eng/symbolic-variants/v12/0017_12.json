{"question": "Olivia walks 19 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 9 mile(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at thrice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 19-mile walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Olivia walks at a rate of 10 miles per 50 minutes, or 10/50 = 1/5 miles per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at thrice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 3*1/5 = 0.6 miles per minute.\nTo walk 9 mile(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 9/0.6 = <<9/0.6=15>>15 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Olivia 50+15 = <<50+15=65>>65 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 65", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
