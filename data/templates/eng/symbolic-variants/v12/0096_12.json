{"question": "Ellen's uncle said that she had $280 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $8 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf is $5. The go-karts cost $11 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The go-karts will cost $22 per person because 11*2 = <<11*2=22>>22\nEach person costs $35 because 8 + 5 + 22 = <<8+5+22=35>>35\n8 total people can attend because 280 / 35 = <<280/35=8>>8\nShe can invite 7 friends because 8 - 1 =<<8-1=7>>7\n#### 7", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
