{"question": "Ashley is knitting winter wear for her 2 grandchildren. They're twins, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a cardigan, vest, tunic, booties, and leg warmers for each of them. It takes 15 skeins of wool to make a cardigan, 13 for a vest, 16 for a tunic, 5 for a pair of booties, and 14 for a pair of leg warmers. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 15 skeins per cardigan + 13 skeins per vest + 16 skeins per tunic + 5 skeins per pair of booties + 14 skeins per pair of leg warmers = <<15+13+16+5+14=63>>63 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 2*63 = <<2*63=126>>126 skeins of wool.\n#### 126", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
