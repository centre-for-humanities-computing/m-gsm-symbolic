{"question": "Chris caught 4 steelheads last Wednesday, the first steelhead he caught weighs 78 kgs, the second steelhead he caught weighs 38 kgs, and the remaining steelhead he caught weighs 22 kgs. If a kg of steelhead costs £0.5, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?", "answer": "Chris will earn 78*£0.5 = £<<78*0.5=39>>39 from the first steelhead.\nHe will earn 38*£0.5 = £<<38*0.5=19>>19 for the second steelhead.\nThe rest of the steelheads are 4-2 = <<4-2=2>>2. He will earn 22*£0.5 = £<<22*0.5=11>>11 per each of them. So he will earn 2 * 11 = <<2*11>>=22\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the steelheads is £39 + £19 + £22= £<<39+19+22=80>>80.\n#### 80", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
