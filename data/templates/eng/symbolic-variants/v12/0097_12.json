{"question": "Emma operates the cash register exactly five times as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jessica. Daily, Jessica processes 85 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?", "answer": "While Jessica is processing 85 orders in a day, Emma processes 85 orders/day*5=<<85*5=425>>425 orders/day.\nIn a day, they process 425 orders/day + 85 orders/day = <<425+85=510>>510 orders together.\nThe total number of orders the two processes in a week is 510 orders/day * 7 days/week = <<510*7=3570>>3570 orders\n#### 3570", "id_orig": 636, "id_shuffled": 97}
