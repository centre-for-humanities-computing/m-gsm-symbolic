{"question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 300 calories per serving. If a 375 oz bag has 5 servings, how many ozs can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2150 and you have already consumed 1700 calories?", "answer": "If the total calorie target is 2150 and I have consumed 1700 calories then I have 2150-1700 = <<2150-1700=450>>450 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of popcorn has 300 calories and I only have 450 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 450/300 of a serving = 3/2 of a serving\nWe also know that a 375 oz bag of popcorn has 5 servings, hence each serving has 375 oz/5 = <<375/5=75>>75 ozs\nIf I can only eat 3/2 of a serving, then I can eat only 75 oz * 3/2 = 112.5 ozs\n#### 112.5", "id_orig": 43, "id_shuffled": 24}
