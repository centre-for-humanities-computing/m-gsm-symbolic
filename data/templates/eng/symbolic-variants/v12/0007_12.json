{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of corns, oats, beets and hay. Since hay are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-pounds boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pounds bags. Corns are the main diet of his horses, so he buys thirty 70-pounds packs. Oats are a staple to supplement the corns, so he buys nineteen 60-pounds sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1650 poundss at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 4*3 = <<4*3=12>>12 poundss of hay.\nHe is buying 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 poundss of beets.\nHe is buying 19*60 = <<19*60=1140>>1140 poundss of oats.\nHe is buying 30*70 = <<30*70=2100>>2100 poundss of corns.\nThe weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 1140 + 2100 = <<12+48+1140+2100=3300>>3300 poundss.\nThus, the farmer needs 3300 / 1650 = <<3300/1650=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
