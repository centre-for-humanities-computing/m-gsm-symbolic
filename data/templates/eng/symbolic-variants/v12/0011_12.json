{"question": "Noah wants to make different sized ice cubes with 156 pounds of water. He can make giant cubes that use 9 pounds per cube, medium cubes that use 4 pounds, and small cubes that use 1/3 pound. If he makes 5 giant cubes, 10 medium cubes, and 24 small cubes, how many pounds of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 45 pounds of water because 5 times 9 equals <<5*9=45>>45.\nThe medium cubes used up 40 pounds of water because 10 times 4 equals <<10*4=40>>40.\nThe small cubes used up 8 pounds of water because 24 times 1/3 equals 8.\nThis means that Noah has used up 93 pounds of water because 45 plus 40 plus 8 equals 93.\nNoah has 63 pounds of water left because 156 minus 93 equals <<156-93=63>>63.\n#### 63", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
