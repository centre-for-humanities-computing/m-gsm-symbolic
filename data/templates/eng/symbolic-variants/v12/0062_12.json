{"question": "In a set of chef's cards, there are 30 red cards, and 70% more orange cards. Blue cards are as many as the sum of red and orange cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 70/100 * 30 = <<70/100*30=21>>21 more orange cards than red cards.\nWhich means there are 30 + 21 = <<30+21=51>>51 orange cards.\nBlue cards make up to 30 + 51 = <<30+51=81>>81 cards.\nSo in total, there are 81 + 81 = <<81+81=162>>162 cards of different colors.\n#### 162", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
