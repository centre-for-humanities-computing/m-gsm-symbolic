{"question": "A clinic has a capacity of 600 rooms with 1/4 occupied. Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the clinic each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the clinic after 2 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/4 of the total capacity of the clinic rooms is occupied, it means 1/4 * 600 = <<600*1/4=150>>150 rooms have patients using them.\nThe total number of rooms in the clinic without new admissions is 600 rooms - 150 rooms = <<600-150=450>>450 rooms.\nIf 20 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the clinic after one week is 20 patients/day * 7 days/week = 140 patients.\nAfter 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the clinic is 140 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<140*2=280>>280 patients, who each use one room.\nIf there were 450 unoccupied rooms in the clinic before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 450 rooms - 280 rooms = <<450-280=170>>170 unoccupied rooms.\n#### 170", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
