{"question": "Chris collects garbage from 4 different apartment complexes. The first three have 350 apartments each and the last one is 50% bigger than the other three combined. He collects garbage 4 times a week from each place and he gets paid £0.55 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first three complexes have 3*350=<<3*350=1050>>1050 apartments\nNumber 4 has 1050*0.5=<<1050*0.5=525>>525 more apartments than those three combined.\nSo in total, it has 1050+525=<<1050+525=1575>>1575 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 1575+1050=<<1575+1050=2625>>2625 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 2625*4=<<2625*4=10,500>>10,500 apartments every week\nSo he makes 10,500*£0.55=£<<10,500*0.55=5775>>5775 every week\n#### 5775", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
