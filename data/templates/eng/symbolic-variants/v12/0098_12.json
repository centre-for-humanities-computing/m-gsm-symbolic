{"question": "A virus infects twenty people. Every day, each infected person infects five others. How many people are infected after three days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original twenty people infect five people each, so 20*5 = <<20*5=100>>100 more people are infected.\nThere are 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 120*5 = <<120*5=600>>600 more people are infected.\nThere are 120 + 600 = <<120+600=720>>720 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 720*5 = 3600 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 720 + 3600 = 4320 infected people after three days.\n#### 4320", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
