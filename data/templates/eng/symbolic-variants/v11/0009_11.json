The tower of stacking rings has 11 multicolored rings on it. Lily recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her brother up to 122. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Lily has 44 + 39 + 11 + T = 94 + T = 122 toys for her brother.\nThus, T = 122 - 94 = <<122-94=28>>28 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 28", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
