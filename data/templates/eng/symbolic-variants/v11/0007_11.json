{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of oats, apples, carrots and corns. Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys six 2-lb boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 8-lb bags. Oats are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys thirty 65-lb packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys eighteen 55-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1500 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 lbs of corns.\nHe is buying 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 lbs of carrots.\nHe is buying 18*55 = <<18*55=990>>990 lbs of apples.\nHe is buying 30*65 = <<30*65=1950>>1950 lbs of oats.\nThe weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 990 + 1950 = <<12+48+990+1950=3000>>3000 lbs.\nThus, the farmer needs 3000 / 1500 = <<3000/1500=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
