{"question": "Lucas collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. The first two have 150 apartments each and the last one is 30% bigger than the other two combined. He collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.35000000000000003 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first two complexes have 2*150=<<2*150=300>>300 apartments\nNumber 3 has 300*0.3=<<300*0.3=90>>90 more apartments than those two combined.\nSo in total, it has 300+90=<<300+90=390>>390 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 390+300=<<390+300=690>>690 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 690*2=<<690*2=1380>>1380 apartments every week\nSo he makes 1380*€0.35000000000000003=€<<1380*0.35000000000000003=483>>483 every week\n#### 483", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
