{"question": "Carl is feeding his livestock grain. Each goat needs 10 pounds, and each cow needs 9 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. If there are 25 goats and 27 cows, how many pounds of grain does Carl need?", "answer": "First figure out how much grain each cow needs: 10 pounds * 2 - 9 = <<10*2-9=11>>11 pounds/cow\nNow figure out how much grain total the cows need: 11 pounds/cow * 27 cows = <<11*27=297>>297 pounds\nNow figure out how much grain total the goats need: 10 pounds/goat * 25 goats = <<10*25=250>>250 pounds\nNow add the two amounts of grain to find the total: 297 pounds + 250 pounds = <<297+250=547>>547 pounds\n#### 547", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
