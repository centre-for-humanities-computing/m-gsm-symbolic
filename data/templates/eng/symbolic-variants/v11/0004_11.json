{"question": "Eric is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 40 pop in the first 26 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 26 seconds. The kernels increase to seven times the initial popping rate in the next 26 seconds, but in the final 26 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 26 seconds. After Eric takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 26 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Eric have to eat?", "answer": "In the second 26 seconds of cooking, 3*40=<<3*40=120>>120 kernels pop.\nIn the third 26 seconds, 7*40=<<7*40=280>>280 kernels pop.\nIn the final 26 seconds, 280 / 2 = <<280/2=140>>140 kernels pop.\nAfter cooking, the residual heat makes 140 / 4 = <<140/4=35>>35 kernels pop.\nThus, Eric has 40 + 120 + 280 + 140 + 35 = <<40+120+280+140+35=615>>615 pieces of popcorn to eat.\n#### 615", "id_orig": 1264, "id_shuffled": 4}
