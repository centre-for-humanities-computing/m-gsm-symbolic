{"question": "Claire's aunt said that she had $260 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $6 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster twice. A round of mini-golf is $6. The roller coaster cost $7 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The roller coaster will cost $14 per person because 7*2 = <<7*2=14>>14\nEach person costs $26 because 6 + 6 + 14 = <<6+6+14=26>>26\n10 total people can attend because 260 / 26 = <<260/26=10>>10\nShe can invite 9 friends because 10 - 1 =<<10-1=9>>9\n#### 9", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
