{"question": "To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay $0.75 for each minute of your call. After 13 minutes, that price drops to $0.2 per minute. How much would a 62-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 13 minutes would be a cost of 13 * 0.75 = $<<13*0.75=9>>9.\nAfter that, there are 62 - 13 = <<62-13=49>>49 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 49 minutes cost 49 * 0.2 = $<<49*0.2=9>>9.\nSo in total, the 62-minute call would cost 9 + 9 = $18.\n#### 19", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
