{"question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 250 calories per serving. If a 300 oz bag has 5 servings, how many ozs can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2200 and you have already consumed 950 calories?", "answer": "If the total calorie target is 2200 and I have consumed 950 calories then I have 2200-950 = <<2200-950=1250>>1250 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of cookies has 250 calories and I only have 1250 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 1250/250 of a serving = 5 of a serving\nWe also know that a 300 oz bag of cookies has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300 oz/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 ozs\nIf I can only eat 5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60 oz * 5 = 300 ozs\n#### 300", "id_orig": 43, "id_shuffled": 24}
