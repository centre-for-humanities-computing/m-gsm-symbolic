{"question": "Amanda is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a sweater, vest, cardigan, mittens, and leg warmers for each of them. It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a sweater, 10 for a vest, 13 for a cardigan, 18 for a pair of mittens, and 16 for a pair of leg warmers. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 5 skeins per sweater + 10 skeins per vest + 13 skeins per cardigan + 18 skeins per pair of mittens + 16 skeins per pair of leg warmers = <<5+10+13+18+16=62>>62 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3*62 = <<3*62=186>>186 skeins of wool.\n#### 186", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
