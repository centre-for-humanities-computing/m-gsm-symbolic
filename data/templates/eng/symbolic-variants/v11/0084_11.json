{"question": "Olivia buys 8 shares of a stock for $41 each. The stock price increases 95% the first year Olivia holds it, then decreases 5% in the second year. What is the final value of all Olivia's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Olivia's purchase: 8 shares * $41/share = $<<8*41=328>>328\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: $328 * 0.95 = $<<328*0.95=311.6>>311\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: $328 + $311.6 = $<<328+311.6=639.6>>639\nThen multiply that amount by 5% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: $639.6 * 5% = $<<639.6*5*.01=31.98>>31\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: $639 - $31 = $<<639-31=607>>607\n#### 607", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
