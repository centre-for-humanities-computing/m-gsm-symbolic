{"question": "William caught 4 cods last Tuesday, the first cod he caught weighs 57 kgs, the second cod he caught weighs 56 kgs, and the remaining cod he caught weighs 30 kgs. If a kg of cod costs £0.75, how much will he earn after selling all the cods to the market?", "answer": "William will earn 57*£0.75 = £<<57*0.75=42.75>>42.75 from the first cod.\nHe will earn 56*£0.75 = £<<56*0.75=42>>42 for the second cod.\nThe rest of the cods are 4-2 = <<4-2=2>>2. He will earn 30*£0.75 = £<<30*0.75=22.5>>22.5 per each of them. So he will earn 2 * 22.5 = <<2*22.5>>=45\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the cods is £42.75 + £42 + £45= £<<42.75+42+45=129>>129.\n#### 129", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
