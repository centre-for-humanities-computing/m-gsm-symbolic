{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 389 minutes to cover every 55 miles of the city. If the city is 52 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 52/55 = <<52/55=0>>0 intervals of 389 minutes.\nThus, it will take 0 * 389 = <<0*389=0>>0 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 0", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
