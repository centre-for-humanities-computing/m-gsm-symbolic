{"question": "Olivia is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the farsi alphabet (with 32 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full thrice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Olivia written in total?", "answer": "Olivia has written the farsi alphabet (with 32 letters) thrice which is a total of 32*3=<<32*3=96>>96 letters.\nShe then writes half the farsi alphabet (with 32 letters), which is 32*1/2=<<32*1/2=16>>16 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 96 + 16 = <<96+16=112>>112 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 112 * 2 = <<112*2=224>>224 letters.\n#### 224", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
