On Wednesday, he sold 11 more boxes of brownies than on Tuesday and 29 boxes of melon pie. If the brownies cost €11 and the melon pie cost €27, how much did Ethan earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 25 + 11 = <<25+11=36>>36 boxes of brownies on Wednesday.\nThe total number of boxes of brownies that Ethan sold is 25 + 36 = <<25+36=61>>61.\nEthan earned 61*€11 = €<<61*11=671>>671 for selling brownies.\nHe sold 29 - 6 = <<29-6=23>>23 boxes of melon pie on Tuesday.\nThe total number of boxes of melon pie that Ethan sold is 29 + 23 = <<29+23=52>>52.\nHe earned 52*€27 = €<<52*27=1404>>1404 for selling melon pie.\nSo, Ethan earned €671 + €1404 = €<<671+1404=2075>>2075 for two days.\n#### 2075", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
