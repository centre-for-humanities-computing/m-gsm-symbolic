{"question": "The vending machines sell pretzels for 70 cents and gum for 75 cents. Chris spent $10 and got 7 bags of pretzels and had 6% of his money left in change. How many gum did he buy?", "answer": "Chris got $0.6 in change because $10*6/100 = <<10*6/100=0.6>>0.6\nChris spent $9.4 because 10 - 0.6 = <<10-0.6=9.4>>9.4\nChris spent $4.9 on pretzels because 7*0.7 = <<7*0.7=4.9>>4.9\nChris spent 4.5 on gum because 9.4 - 4.9 = <<9.4-4.9=4.5>>4.5\nChris bought 6 gum because 4.5 / 0.75 = <<6=6>>6\n#### 6", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
