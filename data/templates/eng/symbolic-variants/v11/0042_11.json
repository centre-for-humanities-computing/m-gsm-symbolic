{"question": "Carl goes to the store to buy some sugar. The normal brand of sugar he buys costs £19 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 15% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses 3 kilogram of sugar per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for £2. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The sugar he bought was 19*0.15=£<<19*0.15=2>>2 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 19+2=£<<19+2=21>>21 per kilogram\nHe goes through 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 kilograms of sugar a week\nSo he paid 21.85*21=£<<21.85*21=458>>458 on sugar\nThat means his total bill was 458+2=£<<458+2=460>>460\n#### 460", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
