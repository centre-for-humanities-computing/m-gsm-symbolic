{"question": "A virus infects twelve people. Every day, each infected person infects three others. How many people are infected after four days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original twelve people infect three people each, so 12*3 = <<12*3=36>>36 more people are infected.\nThere are 12+36 = <<12+36=48>>48 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 48*3 = <<48*3=144>>144 more people are infected.\nThere are 48 + 144 = <<48+144=192>>192 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 192*3 = 576 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 192 + 576 = 3072 infected people after four days.\n#### 3072", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
