{"question": "Olivia is an avid gardener. Last week, she received 49 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 9 potted plants on each of the 52 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 6 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Olivia remain with?", "answer": "Last week, before receiving the plants, Olivia had 9*52 = <<9*52=468>>468 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 49 plants, she therefore had a total of 468 + 49 = <<468+49=517>>517 potted plants\nTomorrow, Olivias plant giveaway will be 52*6 = <<52*6=312>>312 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 517 - 312 = <<517-312=205>>205 potted plants.\n#### 205", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
