{"question": "A medical center has a capacity of 1600 rooms with 1/16 occupied. Due to the pandemic, 95 patients are admitted into the medical center each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the medical center after 2 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/16 of the total capacity of the medical center rooms is occupied, it means 1/16 * 1600 = <<1600*1/16=100>>100 rooms have patients using them.\nThe total number of rooms in the medical center without new admissions is 1600 rooms - 100 rooms = <<1600-100=1500>>1500 rooms.\nIf 95 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the medical center after one week is 95 patients/day * 7 days/week = 665 patients.\nAfter 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the medical center is 665 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<665*2=1330>>1330 patients, who each use one room.\nIf there were 1500 unoccupied rooms in the medical center before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1500 rooms - 1330 rooms = <<1500-1330=170>>170 unoccupied rooms.\n#### 170", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
