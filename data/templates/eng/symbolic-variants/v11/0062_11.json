{"question": "In a set of magician's cards, there are 62 orange cards, and 51% more green cards. Red cards are as many as the sum of orange and green cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 51/100 * 62 = <<51/100*62=31>>31 more green cards than orange cards.\nWhich means there are 62 + 31 = <<62+31=93>>93 green cards.\nRed cards make up to 62 + 93 = <<62+93=155>>155 cards.\nSo in total, there are 155 + 155 = <<155+155=310>>310 cards of different colors.\n#### 310", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
