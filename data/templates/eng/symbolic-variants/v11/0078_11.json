{"question": "There are 8 periods in the day for a normal student but Tyler has to take 1 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/6 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 8+1=<<8+1=9>>9 classes a day\nThat means he spends 35*9=<<35*9=315>>315 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 315*6=<<315*6=1890>>1890 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1890*1/6=<<1890*1/6=315>>315 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 1890+315+315=<<1890+315+315=2520>>2520 minutes per week\nSo he spends 2520/60=<<2520/60=42>>42 hours per week\n#### 42", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
