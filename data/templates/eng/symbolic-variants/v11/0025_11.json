{"question": "In Dr. Lee's class of 144 students, 38% of the class are swimmers. Out of the remaining class, 40% of the students are robotics club members or part of choir members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "38% of the 144 student class are swimmers so that's 0.38*144 = <<0.38*144=54>>54 students\nThere are 144 students and 54 are swimmers so that leaves 144-54 = <<144-54=90>>90 students\n40% of the remaining 90 students are part of choir members or robotics club members so that's 0.4*90 = <<0.4*90=36>>36 students\n54 students are swimmers and 36 are part of choir members/robotics club members so 54+36 = <<54+36=90>>90 students will be leaving early\n#### 90", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
