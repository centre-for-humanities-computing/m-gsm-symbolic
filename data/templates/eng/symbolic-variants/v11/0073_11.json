{"question": "Comet Halley orbits the sun every 65 years. Joshua's uncle saw the Comet when he was 42 years old. Joshua saw the comet a second time when he was two times the age his uncle was when he saw the Comet. How old was Joshua when he saw the Comet for the first time?", "answer": "Joshua saw the Comet for the second time when he was 42 years * 2= <<42*2=84>>84 years old.\nComet Halley can be seen every 65 years, so Joshua saw the comet for the first time when he was 84 years - 65 years = <<84-65=19>>19 years old.\n#### 19", "id_orig": 991, "id_shuffled": 73}
