{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $25 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $1 per pound, get 1 pound 1/12 off.\" She scooped up 7 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $3.0 and 6 magnets that were $1.0 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $1 and gets 1 pound 1/12 off. So 1/12 off of 1 pound is $1*1/12 = $0.08333333333333333. The rest of 5 pound does not have discount and costs 5*$1 = $5, so total is $1+$11/12+$5=$83/12\n6 magnets at $1 each is 6*1=$<<6*1=6>>6\nWhen you add all her purchases, 83/12+$3+$6 = $<<83/12+3+6=15>>15\nShe had $25 and spent $15 so she had $25-$15 = $<<25-15=10>>10 left over\n#### 10", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
