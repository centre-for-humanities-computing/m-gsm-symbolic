{"question": "Henry's van breaks down. The van weighs 2000 pounds and he has furniture in it weighing 450 pounds. He also has his three young teammates who weigh 70 pounds each in it. If the force to move the van is 3% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the van?", "answer": "His three teammates weigh 70*3=<<70*3=210>>210 pounds\nSo the total weight of the van and everything is 2000+450+210=<<2000+450+210=2660>>2660 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 2660*0.03=<<2660*0.03=79>>79 pounds\n#### 79", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
