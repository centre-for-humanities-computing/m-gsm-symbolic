{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Water Wonderland is 380 meters long, and people slide down at 65 meters/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 220 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 85 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 380 meters / 65 meters/minute = <<380/65=5>>5 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 220 meters / 85 meters/minute = <<220/85=2>>2 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 5 minutes - 2 minutes = <<5-2=3>>3 minutes\n#### 3", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
