{"question": "Dr. Martinez sold his condo for $620,000. He paid the transfer fees that amount to 1% of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price. If he also paid $220,000 for the remaining loan amount of the condo, how much is Dr. Martinez's net proceeds from selling the condo?", "answer": "Dr. Martinez paid $620,000*1/100 = $6200 for the transfer fees.\nHe paid $620,000*5/100 = $31,000 for the brokerage fee.\nSo, Dr. Martinez paid a total of $6200 + $31,000 + $220,000 = $257,200 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.\nHence, Dr. Martinez's net proceeds is $620,000 - $257,200 = $362,800.\n#### 362,800", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
