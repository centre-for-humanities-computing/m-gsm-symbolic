{"question": "Mrs. Smith is looking for a apartment that will not go beyond her $460,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $440,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 4% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the apartment than Mrs. Smith's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $440,000*4/100 = $<<440,000*4/100=17,600>>17,600.\nThe transfer fee is $440,000*12/100 = $<<440,000*12/100=52,800>>52,800.\nThe total price of the apartment is $440,000 + $17,600 + $52,800 = $510,400.\nSo, it is $510,400 - $460,000 = $<<510,400-460,000=50,400>>50,400 more than Mrs. Smith's budget.\n#### 50,400", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
