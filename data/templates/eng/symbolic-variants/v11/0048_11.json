{"question": "Olivia can peel 10 clams a minute and saute 35 clams in 11 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 70 clams?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Olivia to peel the clams: 70 clams / 10 clams/minute = <<70/10=7>>7 minutes\nThen find how many batches of clams she needs to cook: 70 clams / 35 clams/batch = <<70/35=2>>2 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 2 batches * 11 minutes/batch = <<2*11=22>>22 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Olivia spends: 22 minutes + 7 minutes = <<22+7=29>>29 minutes\n#### 29", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
