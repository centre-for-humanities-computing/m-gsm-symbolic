{"question": "Michael has a bag of buttons with 40 inside. He tripped over a toy while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 12. When he went back home, he inspected the buttons further. Six of the ones he picked up weren't buttons, but actually beads so he got rid of them. How many buttons did Michael end up with?", "answer": "Michael dropped his buttons and was left with 40*1/2=<<40*1/2=20>>20 buttons.\nHe searched and found some of his lost buttons, getting him back to 20+12=<<20+12=32>>32 buttons.\nHe went home and removed six beads, leaving him with 32-6=<<32-6=26>>26 buttons.\n#### 26", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
