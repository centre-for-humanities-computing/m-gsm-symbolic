{"question": "Jessica and Ashley are sisters from New York who love collecting signatures from authors. During their winter break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Jessica and Ashley compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Jessica has 33 signatures in her book, and Ashley has 39. The sisters have 5 more weeks of winter break, and they decide they want to reach 130 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Jessica and Ashley have already collected 33 + 39 signatures = <<33+39=72>>72 signatures.\nSince their goal is 130, they need to collect 130 - 72 signatures. 130 - 72 = <<130-72=58>>58 signatures\n#### 58", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
