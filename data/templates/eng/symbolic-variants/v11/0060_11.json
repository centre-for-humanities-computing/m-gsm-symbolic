{"question": "Carl works a 10-hour shift each day, three days a week. He earns €12 per hour and gets a €162 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Carl make in June if the company performed very well for the whole month?", "answer": "In a day, Carl makes 10 * 12 = €<<10*12=120>>120\nIf he works three days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 days.\nSince he makes €120 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 12 * 120= €<<12*120=1440>>1440.\nHe also got a 162 * 4 = €<<162*4=648>>648 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of June.\nAt the end of June, he earned 1440 + 648 = €<<1440+648=2088>>2088.\n#### 2088", "id_orig": 304, "id_shuffled": 60}
