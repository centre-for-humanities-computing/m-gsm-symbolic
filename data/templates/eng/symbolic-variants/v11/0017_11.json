{"question": "Jessica walks 28 feets every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 9 feets of walking on the beach and 19 feet(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Jessica walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 54 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 28-feet walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Jessica walks at a rate of 9 feets per 54 minutes, or 9/54 = 1/6 feets per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/6 = 0.3333333333333333 feets per minute.\nTo walk 19 feet(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 19/0.3333333333333333 = <<19/0.3333333333333333=57>>57 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Jessica 54+57 = <<54+57=111>>111 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 111", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
