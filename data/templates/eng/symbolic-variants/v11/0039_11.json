If they work 13 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?", "answer": "They have to clean 21 rooms a day because 105 / 5 = <<105/5=21>>21\nThey spend 210 minutes cleaning per day because 21*10 = <<21*10=210>>210\nThey spend 3.5 hours a day because 210 / 60 = <<210/60=3.5>>3.5\nThey spend 7/26 of their day cleaning rooms because 3.5 / 13 = <<3.5/13=0.2692307692307692>>0.2692307692307692\nThey spend 26% of their day cleaning rooms because 0.2692307692307692*100 = <<0.2692307692307692*100=26>>26\n#### 26", "id_orig": 1239, "id_shuffled": 39}
