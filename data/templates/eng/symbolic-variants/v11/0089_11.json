{"question": "Tyler hires a party bus from 5 PM to 9 PM. He gets 2 hour(s) free. The first paid hour is €38 and each hour after that is four times the cost. How much did he pay?", "answer": "He got it for 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4 hours\nHe pays for 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours\nThe first hour cost 1*38=€<<1*38=38>>38\nThe other 2-1=1 hours are more expensive\nThey cost 38*4=€<<38*4=152>>152 per hour\nSo those 1 hours cost 1*152=€<<1*152=152>>152\nSo he pays 152+38=€<<152+38=190>>190 in total\n#### 190", "id_orig": 652, "id_shuffled": 89}
