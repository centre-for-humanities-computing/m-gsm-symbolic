{"question": "At Lucas's house, there are twice as many apples as grapes. He has a total of 25 grapes in his house.

Find the combined total of the number of apples and grapes Lucas has in the house?", "answer": "Before buying any apple and grape, Lucas had twice as many apples as grapes, which is 25 grapes*2 apple/grape = <<25*2=50>>50 apples\nThe total number of apples and grapes that Lucas had before is 50 apples + 25 grapes = <<50+25=75>>75 items\nWhen he bought 19 fewer apples than grapes, he bought 88 apples - 19 apples = <<88-19=69>>69 apples\nIn total, he bought 69 apples + 88 grapes = <<69+88=157>>157 items\nAfter the purchases, Lucas has 75 items + 157 items = <<75+157=232>>232 total apples and grapes combined.\n#### 232", "id_orig": 406, "id_shuffled": 91}
