{"question": "Oliver watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Thursday and Friday, he watched a 5-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Saturday, he watched a few episodes of a 60-minute show. On Sunday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 60-minute show. On Monday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 1-hour episodes. If he watched 19 hours of TV in all, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Saturday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Saturday.\nAfter Thursday, he had 19 - 5 = <<19-5=14>>14 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 14 - 5 = <<14-5=9>>9 hours of TV left.\nAfter Sunday, he had 9 - 3 - 1 = 5 hours of TV left.\nAfter Monday, he had 5 - 4 = 1 hours of TV left.\nEach 60-minute episode is 1 hour.\nThus, E = 1/1 = 1 episodes.\n#### 1", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
