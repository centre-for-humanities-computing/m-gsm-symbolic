{"question": "One miner can mine 6 pounds of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe and 30% more with a bronze pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 21 miners with bronze pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a miner can mine with an bronze pickaxe: 6 pounds/day*2=<<6*2=12>>12 pounds/day\nThen multiply that amount by 130% to find how much a miner can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 12 pounds/day * 130% = <<12*130*.01=15>>15 pounds/day\nThen multiply the amount one miner can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of miners: 15 pounds/day/miner * 21 miners = <<15*21=327>>327 pounds/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 327 pounds/day * 30 days = <<327*30=9828>>9828 pounds/day\n#### 9828", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
