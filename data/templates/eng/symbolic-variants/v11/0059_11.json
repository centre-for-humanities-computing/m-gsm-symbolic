{"question": "I have 20 liters of lemon drink that are one quarter water and I wish to add it to 20 liters of mango drink that is half water. But as I pour it, I spill four liters of the lemon drink. How much water is in the remaining 36 liters?", "answer": "There are 20*1/2 = <<20*1/2=10>>10 liters of water from the 20 liters mango drink.\nAfter four liters of lemon drink was spilled, there were 20-4 = <<20-4=16>>16 liters of lemon drink left.\nOut of the 16 liters, 16*1/4 = <<16*1/4=4>>4 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 liters of water out of the 36 liters.\n#### 14", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
