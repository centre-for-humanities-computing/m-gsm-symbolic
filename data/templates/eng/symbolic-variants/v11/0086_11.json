{"question": "Sophie qualified for a spot on the soccer team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a t-shirt for €13, a pair of soccer leggings for €7 more than the t-shirt cost, and a pair of sneakers that were originally €42 but were on sale for one third price. She had a coupon for €2 off the package of €8 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The leggings were €7 more than the t-shirt, so they cost €7 + €13 = €<<7+13=20>>20.\nHer sneakers were one third the original €42 price, so they cost €42*1/3=€14.\nWith her coupon, the socks were €8 - €2 = €<<8-2=6>>6.\nThe t-shirt, leggings, sneakers, and socks together cost €13 + €20 + €14 + €6 = €<<13+20+14+6=53>>53.\n#### 53", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
