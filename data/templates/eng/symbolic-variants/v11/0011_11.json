{"question": "Oliver wants to make different sized ice cubes with 100 ozs of water. He can make giant cubes that use 4 ozs per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ozs, and small cubes that use 1/5 oz. If he makes 4 giant cubes, 8 medium cubes, and 15 small cubes, how many ozs of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 16 ozs of water because 4 times 4 equals <<4*4=16>>16.\nThe medium cubes used up 16 ozs of water because 8 times 2 equals <<8*2=16>>16.\nThe small cubes used up 3 ozs of water because 15 times 1/5 equals 3.\nThis means that Oliver has used up 35 ozs of water because 16 plus 16 plus 3 equals 35.\nOliver has 65 ozs of water left because 100 minus 35 equals <<100-35=65>>65.\n#### 65", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
