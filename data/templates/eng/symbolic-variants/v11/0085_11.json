{"question": "If Emma and Anna have 240 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Anna getting 20 feet more than Emma, how much is left over for Emma?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Emma gets and y be the amount Anna gets. We know that y = x + 20, and y + x = 240.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+20=240\nSubtracting the 20 from both sides, we get 2x=220\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=110. This means Emma has 110 feet of fence left over.\n#### 110", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
