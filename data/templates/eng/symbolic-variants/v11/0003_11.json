How many like to play music if the number that like to paint is twice the number that prefer playing golf?", "answer": "The number of students that like to paint is twice as many as the number who like golf, so 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14\nThe number that like to play music is 187 total students - 46 that like to play video games - 7 that like to play golf - 14 that like to paint = <<187-46-7-14=120>>120\n#### 120", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
