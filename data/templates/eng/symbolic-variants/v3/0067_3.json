{"question": "Matt's SUV breaks down. The SUV weighs 1300 pounds and he has furniture in it weighing 100 pounds. He also has his three young children who weigh 75 pounds each in it. If the force to move the SUV is 3% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the SUV?", "answer": "His three children weigh 75*3=<<75*3=225>>225 pounds\nSo the total weight of the SUV and everything is 1300+100+225=<<1300+100+225=1625>>1625 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 1625*0.03=<<1625*0.03=48>>48 pounds\n#### 48", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
