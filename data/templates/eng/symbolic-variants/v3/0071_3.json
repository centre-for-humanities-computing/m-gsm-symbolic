{"question": "Bob is feeding his livestock hay. Each horse needs 4 kg, and each duck needs 6 kg less than twice the amount each horse needs. If there are 30 horses and 33 ducks, how many kg of hay does Bob need?", "answer": "First figure out how much hay each duck needs: 4 kg * 2 - 6 = <<4*2-6=2>>2 kg/duck\nNow figure out how much hay total the ducks need: 2 kg/duck * 33 ducks = <<2*33=66>>66 kg\nNow figure out how much hay total the horses need: 4 kg/horse * 30 horses = <<4*30=120>>120 kg\nNow add the two amounts of hay to find the total: 66 kg + 120 kg = <<66+120=186>>186 kg\n#### 186", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
