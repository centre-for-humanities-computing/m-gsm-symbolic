{"question": "Lucas goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs €6 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 15% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kilogram of rice per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for €2. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The rice he bought was 6*0.15=€<<6*0.15=0>>0 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 6+0=€<<6+0=6>>6 per kilogram\nHe goes through 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 kilograms of rice a week\nSo he paid 6.9*21=€<<6.9*21=144>>144 on rice\nThat means his total bill was 144+2=€<<144+2=146>>146\n#### 146", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
