{"question": "In Mr. Smith's class of 139 students, 40% of the class are volleyball players. Out of the remaining class, 37% of the students are dancers or part of debate team members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "40% of the 139 student class are volleyball players so that's 0.4*139 = <<0.4*139=55>>55 students\nThere are 139 students and 55 are volleyball players so that leaves 139-55 = <<139-55=84>>84 students\n37% of the remaining 84 students are part of debate team members or dancers so that's 0.37*84 = <<0.37*84=31>>31 students\n55 students are volleyball players and 31 are part of debate team members/dancers so 55+31 = <<55+31=86>>86 students will be leaving early\n#### 86", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
