{"question": "Olivia can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is two thirds as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 4 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in four hours if she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking?", "answer": "If Olivia can skip at two thirds the speed she can run, then she can run at 4*3/2=<<4*3/2=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/2=3 miles per hour.\nIf half of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 4*1/2=<<4*1/2=2>>2 hours.\nIf half of the time is spent running, then she runs for 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.\nShe walks for 2 hours at 3 miles per hour, or 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.\n#### 18", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
