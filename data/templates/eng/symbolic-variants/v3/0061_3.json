{"question": "Eric has a bag of pebbles with 54 inside. He tripped over a stick while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 12. When he went back home, he inspected the pebbles further. Nine of the ones he picked up weren't pebbles, but actually coins so he got rid of them. How many pebbles did Eric end up with?", "answer": "Eric dropped his pebbles and was left with 54*1/2=<<54*1/2=27>>27 pebbles.\nHe searched and found some of his lost pebbles, getting him back to 27+12=<<27+12=39>>39 pebbles.\nHe went home and removed nine coins, leaving him with 39-9=<<39-9=30>>30 pebbles.\n#### 30", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
