On Tuesday, he sold 11 more boxes of brownies than on Monday and 27 boxes of raspberry pie. If the brownies cost €8 and the raspberry pie cost €20, how much did Chris earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 25 + 11 = <<25+11=36>>36 boxes of brownies on Tuesday.\nThe total number of boxes of brownies that Chris sold is 25 + 36 = <<25+36=61>>61.\nChris earned 61*€8 = €<<61*8=488>>488 for selling brownies.\nHe sold 27 - 6 = <<27-6=21>>21 boxes of raspberry pie on Monday.\nThe total number of boxes of raspberry pie that Chris sold is 27 + 21 = <<27+21=48>>48.\nHe earned 48*€20 = €<<48*20=960>>960 for selling raspberry pie.\nSo, Chris earned €488 + €960 = €<<488+960=1448>>1448 for two days.\n#### 1448", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
