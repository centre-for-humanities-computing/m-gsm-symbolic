{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $33 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $3 per pound, get 1 pound 1/3 off.\" She scooped up 4 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $3.0 and 6 magnets that were $0.5 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound 1/3 off. So 1/3 off of 1 pound is $3*1/3 = $1. The rest of 2 pound does not have discount and costs 2*$3 = $6, so total is $3+$2+$6=$11\n6 magnets at $0.5 each is 6*0.5=$<<6*0.5=3>>3\nWhen you add all her purchases, 11+$3+$3 = $<<11+3+3=17>>17\nShe had $33 and spent $17 so she had $33-$17 = $<<33-17=16>>16 left over\n#### 16", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
