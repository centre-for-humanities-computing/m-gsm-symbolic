If they work 9 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?", "answer": "They have to clean 10 floors a day because 90 / 9 = <<90/9=10>>10\nThey spend 300 minutes cleaning per day because 10*30 = <<10*30=300>>300\nThey spend 5 hours a day because 300 / 60 = <<300/60=5>>5\nThey spend 5/9 of their day cleaning floors because 5 / 9 = <<5/9=0.5555555555555556>>0.5555555555555556\nThey spend 55% of their day cleaning floors because 0.5555555555555556*100 = <<0.5555555555555556*100=55>>55\n#### 55", "id_orig": 1239, "id_shuffled": 39}
