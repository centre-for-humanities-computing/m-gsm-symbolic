{"question": "Isabella is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a hat, sweater, beanie, booties, and gloves for each of them. It takes 14 skeins of wool to make a hat, 9 for a sweater, 3 for a beanie, 8 for a pair of booties, and 12 for a pair of gloves. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 14 skeins per hat + 9 skeins per sweater + 3 skeins per beanie + 8 skeins per pair of booties + 12 skeins per pair of gloves = <<14+9+3+8+12=46>>46 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3*46 = <<3*46=138>>138 skeins of wool.\n#### 138", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
