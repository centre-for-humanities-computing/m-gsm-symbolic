{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his sheep. He buys a variety of wheats, corns, beets and oats. Since oats are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-pounds boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pounds bags. Wheats are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys forty-two 70-pounds packs. Corns are a staple to supplement the wheats, so he buys twenty 45-pounds sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1950 poundss at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 4*3 = <<4*3=12>>12 poundss of oats.\nHe is buying 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 poundss of beets.\nHe is buying 20*45 = <<20*45=900>>900 poundss of corns.\nHe is buying 42*70 = <<42*70=2940>>2940 poundss of wheats.\nThe weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 900 + 2940 = <<12+48+900+2940=3900>>3900 poundss.\nThus, the farmer needs 3900 / 1950 = <<3900/1950=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
