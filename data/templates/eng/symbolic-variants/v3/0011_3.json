{"question": "Ethan wants to make different sized ice cubes with 196 poundss of water. He can make giant cubes that use 8 poundss per cube, medium cubes that use 3 poundss, and small cubes that use 1/8 pounds. If he makes 4 giant cubes, 10 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many poundss of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 32 poundss of water because 4 times 8 equals <<4*8=32>>32.\nThe medium cubes used up 30 poundss of water because 10 times 3 equals <<10*3=30>>30.\nThe small cubes used up 1 poundss of water because 8 times 1/8 equals 1.\nThis means that Ethan has used up 63 poundss of water because 32 plus 30 plus 1 equals 63.\nEthan has 133 poundss of water left because 196 minus 63 equals <<196-63=133>>133.\n#### 133", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
