{"question": "A infection infects seventeen people. Every day, each infected person infects six others. How many people are infected after three days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original seventeen people infect six people each, so 17*6 = <<17*6=102>>102 more people are infected.\nThere are 17+102 = <<17+102=119>>119 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 119*6 = <<119*6=714>>714 more people are infected.\nThere are 119 + 714 = <<119+714=833>>833 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 833*6 = 4998 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 833 + 4998 = 5831 infected people after three days.\n#### 5831", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
