{"question": "Sophia qualified for a spot on the cycling team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a jersey for €14, a pair of cycling leggings for €14 more than the jersey cost, and a pair of sneakers that were originally €40 but were on sale for three fifths price. She had a coupon for €1 off the package of €8 athletic headbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The leggings were €14 more than the jersey, so they cost €14 + €14 = €<<14+14=28>>28.\nHer sneakers were three fifths the original €40 price, so they cost €40*3/5=€24.\nWith her coupon, the headbands were €8 - €1 = €<<8-1=7>>7.\nThe jersey, leggings, sneakers, and headbands together cost €14 + €28 + €24 + €7 = €<<14+28+24+7=73>>73.\n#### 73", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
