{"question": "Noah saw a 310-foot whale with 8 93-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the whale's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 93 inches/remora * 8 remoras = <<93*8=744>>744 inches.\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 744 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<744/12=62>>62 foot.\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the whale's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 62 foot / 310 feet * 100% = 20%\n\n#### 20", "id_orig": 473, "id_shuffled": 0}
