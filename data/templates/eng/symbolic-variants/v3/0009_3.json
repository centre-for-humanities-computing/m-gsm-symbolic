{"question": "When Claire watches her cousin, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 68 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 16 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 26 multicolored rings on it. Claire recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her cousin up to 131. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Claire has 68 + 16 + 26 + T = 110 + T = 131 toys for her cousin.\nThus, T = 131 - 110 = <<131-110=21>>21 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 21", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
