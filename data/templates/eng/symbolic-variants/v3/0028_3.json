{"question": "A care facility has a capacity of 1100 beds with 1/4 occupied. Due to the pandemic, 20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the care facility after 2 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/4 of the total capacity of the care facility beds is occupied, it means 1/4 * 1100 = <<1100*1/4=275>>275 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the care facility without new admissions is 1100 beds - 275 beds = <<1100-275=825>>825 beds.\nIf 20 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the care facility after one week is 20 patients/day * 7 days/week = 140 patients.\nAfter 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the care facility is 140 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<140*2=280>>280 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 825 unoccupied beds in the care facility before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 825 beds - 280 beds = <<825-280=545>>545 unoccupied beds.\n#### 545", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
