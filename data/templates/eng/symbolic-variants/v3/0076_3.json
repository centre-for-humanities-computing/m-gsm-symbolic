{"question": "Eric caught 5 steelheads last Monday, the first steelhead he caught weighs 72 kilograms, the second steelhead he caught weighs 33 kilograms, and the remaining steelhead he caught weighs 34 kilograms. If a kilogram of steelhead costs $2.25, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?", "answer": "Eric will earn 72*$2.25 = $<<72*2.25=162>>162 from the first steelhead.\nHe will earn 33*$2.25 = $<<33*2.25=74.25>>74.25 for the second steelhead.\nThe rest of the steelheads are 5-2 = <<5-2=3>>3. He will earn 34*$2.25 = $<<34*2.25=76.5>>76.5 per each of them. So he will earn 3 * 76.5 = <<3*76.5>>=229.5\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the steelheads is $162 + $74.25 + $229.5= $<<162+74.25+229.5=465>>465.\n#### 465", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
