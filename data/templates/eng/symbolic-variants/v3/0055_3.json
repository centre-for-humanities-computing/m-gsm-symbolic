{"question": "Andrea is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full five times, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Andrea written in total?", "answer": "Andrea has written the alphabet five times which is a total of 26*5=<<26*5=130>>130 letters.\nShe then writes half the alphabet, which is 26*1/2=<<26*1/2=13>>13 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 130 + 13 = <<130+13=143>>143 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 143 * 2 = <<143*2=286>>286 letters.\n#### 286", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
