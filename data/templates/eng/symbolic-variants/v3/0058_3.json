{"question": "One gnome can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a silver pickaxe and 35% more with a titanium pickaxe than with a silver pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 22 gnomes with titanium pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a gnome can mine with an silver pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day\nThen multiply that amount by 135% to find how much a gnome can mine with a titanium pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 135% = <<10*135*.01=13>>13 pounds/day\nThen multiply the amount one gnome can mine in a day with a titanium pickaxe by the number of gnomes: 13 pounds/day/gnome * 22 gnomes = <<13*22=297>>297 pounds/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 297 pounds/day * 30 days = <<297*30=8910>>8910 pounds/day\n#### 8910", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
