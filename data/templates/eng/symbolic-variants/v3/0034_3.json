{"question": "Mr. Martinez sold his cottage for $270,000. He paid the registration fees that amount to 1% of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 4% of the selling price. If he also paid $220,000 for the remaining loan amount of the cottage, how much is Mr. Martinez's net proceeds from selling the cottage?", "answer": "Mr. Martinez paid $270,000*1/100 = $2700 for the registration fees.\nHe paid $270,000*4/100 = $10,800 for the brokerage fee.\nSo, Mr. Martinez paid a total of $2700 + $10,800 + $220,000 = $233,500 for the registration, brokerage, and loan fees.\nHence, Mr. Martinez's net proceeds is $270,000 - $233,500 = $36,500.\n#### 36,500", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
