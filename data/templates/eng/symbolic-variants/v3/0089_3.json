{"question": "Oliver hires a boat from 3 PM to 6 PM. He gets 1 hour(s) free. The first paid hour is £42 and each hour after that is thrice the cost. How much did he pay?", "answer": "He got it for 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 hours\nHe pays for 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 hours\nThe first hour cost 1*42=£<<1*42=42>>42\nThe other 2-1=1 hours are more expensive\nThey cost 42*3=£<<42*3=126>>126 per hour\nSo those 1 hours cost 1*126=£<<1*126=126>>126\nSo he pays 126+42=£<<126+42=168>>168 in total\n#### 168", "id_orig": 652, "id_shuffled": 89}
