{"question": "Sophie buys 16 shares of a stock for £65 each. The stock price increases 95% the first year Sophie holds it, then decreases 15% in the second year. What is the final value of all Sophie's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Sophie's purchase: 16 shares * £65/share = £<<16*65=1040>>1040\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: £1040 * 0.95 = £<<1040*0.95=988>>988\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: £1040 + £988 = £<<1040+988=2028>>2028\nThen multiply that amount by 15% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: £2028 * 15% = £<<2028*15*.01=304.2>>304\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: £2028 - £304 = £<<2028-304=1723>>1723\n#### 1723", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
