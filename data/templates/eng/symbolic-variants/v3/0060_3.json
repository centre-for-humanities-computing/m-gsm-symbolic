{"question": "Chris works a 11-hour shift each day, five days a week. He earns £11 per hour and gets a £444 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did Chris make in February if the company performed very well for the whole month?", "answer": "In a day, Chris makes 11 * 11 = £<<11*11=121>>121\nIf he works five days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 days.\nSince he makes £121 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 121= £<<20*121=2420>>2420.\nHe also got a 444 * 4 = £<<444*4=1776>>1776 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of February.\nAt the end of February, he earned 2420 + 1776 = £<<2420+1776=4196>>4196.\n#### 4196", "id_orig": 304, "id_shuffled": 60}
