{"question": "In a 100-item quiz, 40% of the questions are history, and the rest are equally divided as literature and physics questions. If Andrea is sure to get 30% of the history questions, and half of the literature and physics questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?", "answer": "The literature and physics questions comprises 100% - 40% = 60% of the quiz.\nThere are 100 questions*40/100 = <<100*40/100=40>>40 history questions.\nThere are a total of 100 questions*60/100 = <<100*60/100=60>>60 literature and physics questions.\nIf Andrea is sure to get 30% of the history questions, then this means she is sure of her 40 questions*30/100 = <<40*30/100=12>>12 points.\nFrom the literature and physics questions, she is sure to get half of it correctly so that is 60 questions*1/2 = <<60*1/2=30>>30 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 12 points + 30 points = <<12+30=42>>42 points in her quiz.\n#### 42", "id_orig": 1021, "id_shuffled": 19}
