{"question": "I have 9 liters of lemon drink that are one quarter water and I wish to add it to 30 liters of peach drink that is one third water. But as I pour it, I spill five liters of the lemon drink. How much water is in the remaining 34 liters?", "answer": "There are 30*1/3 = <<30*1/3=10>>10 liters of water from the 30 liters peach drink.\nAfter five liters of lemon drink was spilled, there were 9-5 = <<9-5=4>>4 liters of lemon drink left.\nOut of the 4 liters, 4*1/4 = <<4*1/4=1>>1 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 liters of water out of the 34 liters.\n#### 11", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
