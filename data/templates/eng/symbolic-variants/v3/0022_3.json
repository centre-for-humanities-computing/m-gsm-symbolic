Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 31 plates. How many plates were in the package that Madison bought?", "answer": "The total number of plates from Madison and her husband was 31+4=<<31+4=35>>35 plates.\nSince the husband bought a package of 8 plates, then Madison's package contained 35-8=<<35-8=27>>27 plates.\n#### 27", "id_orig": 125, "id_shuffled": 22}
