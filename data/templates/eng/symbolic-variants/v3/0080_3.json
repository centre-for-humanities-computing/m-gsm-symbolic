{"question": "The vending machines sell cookies for 60 cents and gum for 110 cents. David spent £10 and got 1 bags of cookies and had 6% of his money left in change. How many gum did he buy?", "answer": "David got £0.6 in change because £10*6/100 = <<10*6/100=0.6>>0.6\nDavid spent £9.4 because 10 - 0.6 = <<10-0.6=9.4>>9.4\nDavid spent £0.6 on cookies because 1*0.6 = <<1*0.6=0.6>>0.6\nDavid spent 8.8 on gum because 9.4 - 0.6 = <<9.4-0.6=8.8>>8.8\nDavid bought 8 gum because 8.8 / 1.1 = <<8=8>>8\n#### 8", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
