{"question": "Ms. Johnson is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $350,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $320,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 6% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 10% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the house than Ms. Johnson's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $320,000*6/100 = $<<320,000*6/100=19,200>>19,200.\nThe transfer fee is $320,000*10/100 = $<<320,000*10/100=32,000>>32,000.\nThe total price of the house is $320,000 + $19,200 + $32,000 = $371,200.\nSo, it is $371,200 - $350,000 = $<<371,200-350,000=21,200>>21,200 more than Ms. Johnson's budget.\n#### 21,200", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
