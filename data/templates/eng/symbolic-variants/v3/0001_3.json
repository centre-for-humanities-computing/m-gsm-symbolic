{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 319 minutes to cover every 96 miles of the city. If the city is 66 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 66/96 = <<66/96=0>>0 intervals of 319 minutes.\nThus, it will take 0 * 319 = <<0*319=0>>0 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 0", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
