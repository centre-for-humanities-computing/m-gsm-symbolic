How many like to bake if the number that like to read is twice the number that prefer playing golf?", "answer": "The number of students that like to read is twice as many as the number who like golf, so 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40\nThe number that like to bake is 143 total students - 50 that like to play music - 20 that like to play golf - 40 that like to read = <<143-50-20-40=33>>33\n#### 33", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
