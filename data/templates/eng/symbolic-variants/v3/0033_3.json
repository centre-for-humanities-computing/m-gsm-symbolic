{"question": "Ella and Amanda are sisters from Chicago who love collecting signatures from movie stars. During their winter break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 5 weeks, Ella and Amanda compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Ella has 28 signatures in her book, and Amanda has 31. The sisters have 2 more weeks of winter break, and they decide they want to reach 125 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Ella and Amanda have already collected 28 + 31 signatures = <<28+31=59>>59 signatures.\nSince their goal is 125, they need to collect 125 - 59 signatures. 125 - 59 = <<125-59=66>>66 signatures\n#### 66", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
