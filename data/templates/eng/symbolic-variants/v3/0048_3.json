{"question": "Emily can peel 7 carrots a minute and saute 20 carrots in 20 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 140 carrots?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Emily to peel the carrots: 140 carrots / 7 carrots/minute = <<140/7=20>>20 minutes\nThen find how many batches of carrots she needs to cook: 140 carrots / 20 carrots/batch = <<140/20=7>>7 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 7 batches * 20 minutes/batch = <<7*20=140>>140 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 140 minutes + 20 minutes = <<140+20=160>>160 minutes\n#### 160", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
