{"question": "There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Ethan has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 55 minutes long. He goes to class for 5 days a week. He then spends 1/10 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day\nThat means he spends 55*8=<<55*8=440>>440 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 440*5=<<440*5=2200>>2200 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 2200*1/10=<<2200*1/10=220>>220 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 2200+220+220=<<2200+220+220=2640>>2640 minutes per week\nSo he spends 2640/60=<<2640/60=44>>44 hours per week\n#### 44", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
