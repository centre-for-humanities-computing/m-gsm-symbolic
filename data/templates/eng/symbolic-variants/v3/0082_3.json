{"question": "At the beginning of the gathering, there were 50 engineers and 58 doctors. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. How many doctors are left if 31 engineers stayed at the gathering?", "answer": "There were a total of 50 engineers + 58 doctors = <<50+58=108>>108 people who attended the gathering.\nAfter an hour, 108 people * 1/4 = <<108*1/4=27>>27 people left the gathering.\nThis means 108 people - 27 people = <<108-27=81>>81 people stayed.\nOut of the 81 who stayed, 81 people - 31 engineers = <<81-31=50>>50 were doctors.\n#### 50", "id_orig": 320, "id_shuffled": 82}
