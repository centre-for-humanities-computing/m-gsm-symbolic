{"question": "To make a call from a phone booth, you must pay €0.75 for each minute of your call. After 36 minutes, that price drops to €0.5 per minute. How much would a 64-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 36 minutes would be a cost of 36 * 0.75 = €<<36*0.75=27>>27.\nAfter that, there are 64 - 36 = <<64-36=28>>28 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 28 minutes cost 28 * 0.5 = €<<28*0.5=14>>14.\nSo in total, the 64-minute call would cost 27 + 14 = €41.\n#### 41", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
