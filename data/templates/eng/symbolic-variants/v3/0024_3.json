{"question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving. If a 100 oz bag has 5 servings, how many ozs can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2200 and you have already consumed 1400 calories?", "answer": "If the total calorie target is 2200 and I have consumed 1400 calories then I have 2200-1400 = <<2200-1400=800>>800 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of popcorn has 200 calories and I only have 800 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 800/200 of a serving = 4 of a serving\nWe also know that a 100 oz bag of popcorn has 5 servings, hence each serving has 100 oz/5 = <<100/5=20>>20 ozs\nIf I can only eat 4 of a serving, then I can eat only 20 oz * 4 = 80 ozs\n#### 80", "id_orig": 43, "id_shuffled": 24}
