What percent of her spools are brown?", "answer": "First find the number of brown spools: 85 spools + 125 spools = <<85+125=210>>210 spools\nThen find the total number of spools: 30 spools + 80 spools + 210 spools = <<30+80+210=320>>320 spools\nThen divide the number of brown spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 210 spools / 320 spools * 100% = 65%\n#### 65", "id_orig": 728, "id_shuffled": 66}
