{"question": "Bob watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Thursday and Friday, he watched a 5-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Saturday, he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show. On Sunday, he finished homework early and watched a 2-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Monday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 4-hour episodes. If he watched 27 hours of TV in all, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Saturday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Saturday.\nAfter Thursday, he had 27 - 5 = <<27-5=22>>22 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 22 - 5 = <<22-5=17>>17 hours of TV left.\nAfter Sunday, he had 17 - 2 - 0.5 = 14.5 hours of TV left.\nAfter Monday, he had 14.5 - 12 = 2.5 hours of TV left.\nEach 45-minute episode is 3/4 hour.\nThus, E = 2.5/0.75 = 3.3333333333333335 episodes.\n#### 3.3333333333333335", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
