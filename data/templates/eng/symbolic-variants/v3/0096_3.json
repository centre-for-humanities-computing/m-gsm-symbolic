{"question": "Madison's aunt said that she had £190 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of laser tag, have £3 in game room tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of laser tag is £9. The go-karts cost £13 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The go-karts will cost £26 per person because 13*2 = <<13*2=26>>26\nEach person costs £38 because 3 + 9 + 26 = <<3+9+26=38>>38\n5 total people can attend because 190 / 38 = <<190/38=5>>5\nShe can invite 4 friends because 5 - 1 =<<5-1=4>>4\n#### 4", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
