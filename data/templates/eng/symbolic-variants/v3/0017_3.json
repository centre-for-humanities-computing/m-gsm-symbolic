{"question": "Jessica walks 28 feets every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 15 feets of walking on the beach and 13 feet(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Jessica walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 28-feet walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Jessica walks at a rate of 15 feets per 60 minutes, or 15/60 = 1/4 feets per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/4 = 0.5 feets per minute.\nTo walk 13 feet(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 13/0.5 = <<13/0.5=26>>26 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Jessica 60+26 = <<60+26=86>>86 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 86", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
