{"question": "In a set of magician's cards, there are 79 yellow cards, and 20% more red cards. Blue cards are as many as the sum of yellow and red cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 20/100 * 79 = <<20/100*79=15>>15 more red cards than yellow cards.\nWhich means there are 79 + 15 = <<79+15=94>>94 red cards.\nBlue cards make up to 79 + 94 = <<79+94=173>>173 cards.\nSo in total, there are 173 + 173 = <<173+173=346>>346 cards of different colors.\n#### 346", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
