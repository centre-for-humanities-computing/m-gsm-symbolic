{"question": "Lucas collects garbage from 6 different apartment complexes. The first five have 450 apartments each and the last one is 55% bigger than the other five combined. He collects garbage 4 times a week from each place and he gets paid £0.25 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first five complexes have 5*450=<<5*450=2250>>2250 apartments\nNumber 6 has 2250*0.55=<<2250*0.55=1237.5>>1237 more apartments than those five combined.\nSo in total, it has 2250+1237=<<2250+1237=3487>>3487 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 3487+2250=<<3487+2250=5737.5>>5737 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 5737*4=<<5737*4=22,950>>22,950 apartments every week\nSo he makes 22,950*£0.25=£<<22,950*0.25=5737>>5737 every week\n#### 5737", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
