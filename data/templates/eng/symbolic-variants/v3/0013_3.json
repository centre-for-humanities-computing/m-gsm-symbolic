{"question": "Sophie is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 38 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 7 potted plants on each of the 65 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 2 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Sophie remain with?", "answer": "Two days ago, before receiving the plants, Sophie had 7*65 = <<7*65=455>>455 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 38 plants, she therefore had a total of 455 + 38 = <<455+38=493>>493 potted plants\nTomorrow, Sophies plant giveaway will be 65*2 = <<65*2=130>>130 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 493 - 130 = <<493-130=363>>363 potted plants.\n#### 363", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
