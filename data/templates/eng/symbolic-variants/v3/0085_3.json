{"question": "If Abby and Olivia have 280 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Olivia getting 150 yards more than Abby, how much is left over for Abby?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Abby gets and y be the amount Olivia gets. We know that y = x + 150, and y + x = 280.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+150=280\nSubtracting the 150 from both sides, we get 2x=130\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=65. This means Abby has 65 yards of fence left over.\n#### 65", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
