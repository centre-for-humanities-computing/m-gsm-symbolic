{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Splash World is 300 meters long, and people slide down at 50 meters/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 230 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 65 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 300 meters / 50 meters/minute = <<300/50=6>>6 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 230 meters / 65 meters/minute = <<230/65=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 6 minutes - 3 minutes = <<6-3=3>>3 minutes\n#### 3", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
