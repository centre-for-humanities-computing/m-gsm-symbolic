{"question": "Tyler collects garbage from 5 different apartment complexes. The first four have 350 apartments each and the last one is 55% bigger than the other four combined. He collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.30000000000000004 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first four complexes have 4*350=<<4*350=1400>>1400 apartments\nNumber 5 has 1400*0.55=<<1400*0.55=770>>770 more apartments than those four combined.\nSo in total, it has 1400+770=<<1400+770=2170>>2170 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 2170+1400=<<2170+1400=3570>>3570 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 3570*2=<<3570*2=7140>>7140 apartments every week\nSo he makes 7140*€0.30000000000000004=€<<7140*0.30000000000000004=2142>>2142 every week\n#### 2142", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
