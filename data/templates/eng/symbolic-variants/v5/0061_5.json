{"question": "Joe has a bag of marbles with 62 inside. He tripped over a stick while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 14. When he went back home, he inspected the marbles further. Eight of the ones he picked up weren't marbles, but actually coins so he got rid of them. How many marbles did Joe end up with?", "answer": "Joe dropped his marbles and was left with 62*1/2=<<62*1/2=31>>31 marbles.\nHe searched and found some of his lost marbles, getting him back to 31+14=<<31+14=45>>45 marbles.\nHe went home and removed eight coins, leaving him with 45-8=<<45-8=37>>37 marbles.\n#### 37", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
