{"question": "Sophie is an avid gardener. Last week, she received 30 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 5 potted plants on each of the 47 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 4 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Sophie remain with?", "answer": "Last week, before receiving the plants, Sophie had 5*47 = <<5*47=235>>235 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 30 plants, she therefore had a total of 235 + 30 = <<235+30=265>>265 potted plants\nTomorrow, Sophies plant giveaway will be 47*4 = <<47*4=188>>188 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 265 - 188 = <<265-188=77>>77 potted plants.\n#### 77", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
