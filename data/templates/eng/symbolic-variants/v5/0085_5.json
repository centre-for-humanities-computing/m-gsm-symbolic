{"question": "If Kenneth and Maya have 480 meters of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Maya getting 20 meters more than Kenneth, how much is left over for Kenneth?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Kenneth gets and y be the amount Maya gets. We know that y = x + 20, and y + x = 480.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+20=480\nSubtracting the 20 from both sides, we get 2x=460\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=230. This means Kenneth has 230 meters of fence left over.\n#### 230", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
