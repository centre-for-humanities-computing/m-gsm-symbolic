If Joe can eat 3 servings a day while Emily can eat twice as much, how many days will the pie last?", "answer": "Emily can eat 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 servings a day.\nTogether, Joe and Emily can eat 3 + 6 = <<3+6=9>>9 servings a day.\nSo, a pie will last for 18/9 = <<18/9=2>>2 days.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 921, "id_shuffled": 37}
