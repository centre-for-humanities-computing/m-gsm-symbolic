{"question": "In Mrs. Garcia's class of 127 students, 17% of the class are swimmers. Out of the remaining class, 17% of the students are debate team members or part of robotics club members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "17% of the 127 student class are swimmers so that's 0.17*127 = <<0.17*127=21>>21 students\nThere are 127 students and 21 are swimmers so that leaves 127-21 = <<127-21=106>>106 students\n17% of the remaining 106 students are part of robotics club members or debate team members so that's 0.17*106 = <<0.17*106=18>>18 students\n21 students are swimmers and 18 are part of robotics club members/debate team members so 21+18 = <<21+18=39>>39 students will be leaving early\n#### 39", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
