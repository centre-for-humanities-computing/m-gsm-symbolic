{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 135 minutes to cover every 43 miles of the city. If the city is 43 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 43/43 = <<43/43=1>>1 intervals of 135 minutes.\nThus, it will take 1 * 135 = <<1*135=135>>135 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 135", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
