{"question": "Sophia is knitting winter wear for her 2 grandchildren. They're twins, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a beanie, hat, shawl, gloves, and socks for each of them. It takes 16 skeins of wool to make a beanie, 15 for a hat, 12 for a shawl, 4 for a pair of gloves, and 9 for a pair of socks. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 16 skeins per beanie + 15 skeins per hat + 12 skeins per shawl + 4 skeins per pair of gloves + 9 skeins per pair of socks = <<16+15+12+4+9=56>>56 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 2*56 = <<2*56=112>>112 skeins of wool.\n#### 112", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
