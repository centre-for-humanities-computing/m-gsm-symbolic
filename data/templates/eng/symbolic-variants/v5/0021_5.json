{"question": "Tyler watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Saturday and Sunday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode and a 60-minute show. On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 1-hour episodes. If he watched 12 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Monday.\nAfter Saturday, he had 12 - 1 = <<12-1=11>>11 hours of TV left.\nAfter Sunday, he had 11 - 1 = <<11-1=10>>10 hours of TV left.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 10 - 4 - 1 = 5 hours of TV left.\nAfter Wednesday, he had 5 - 4 = 1 hours of TV left.\nEach 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.\nThus, E = 1/0.5 = 2 episodes.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
