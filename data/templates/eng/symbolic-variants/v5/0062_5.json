{"question": "In a set of artist's cards, there are 53 blue cards, and 49% more purple cards. Yellow cards are as many as the sum of blue and purple cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 49/100 * 53 = <<49/100*53=25>>25 more purple cards than blue cards.\nWhich means there are 53 + 25 = <<53+25=78>>78 purple cards.\nYellow cards make up to 53 + 78 = <<53+78=131>>131 cards.\nSo in total, there are 131 + 131 = <<131+131=262>>262 cards of different colors.\n#### 262", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
