{"question": "Lucas hires a boat from 3 PM to 10 PM. He gets 1 hour(s) free. The first paid hour is £38 and each hour after that is thrice the cost. How much did he pay?", "answer": "He got it for 10-3=<<10-3=7>>7 hours\nHe pays for 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 hours\nThe first hour cost 1*38=£<<1*38=38>>38\nThe other 6-1=5 hours are more expensive\nThey cost 38*3=£<<38*3=114>>114 per hour\nSo those 5 hours cost 5*114=£<<5*114=570>>570\nSo he pays 570+38=£<<570+38=608>>608 in total\n#### 608", "id_orig": 652, "id_shuffled": 89}
