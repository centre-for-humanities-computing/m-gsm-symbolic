On Sunday, he sold 13 more boxes of brownies than on Saturday and 29 boxes of orange pie. If the brownies cost €7 and the orange pie cost €30, how much did Eric earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 21 + 13 = <<21+13=34>>34 boxes of brownies on Sunday.\nThe total number of boxes of brownies that Eric sold is 21 + 34 = <<21+34=55>>55.\nEric earned 55*€7 = €<<55*7=385>>385 for selling brownies.\nHe sold 29 - 17 = <<29-17=12>>12 boxes of orange pie on Saturday.\nThe total number of boxes of orange pie that Eric sold is 29 + 12 = <<29+12=41>>41.\nHe earned 41*€30 = €<<41*30=1230>>1230 for selling orange pie.\nSo, Eric earned €385 + €1230 = €<<385+1230=1615>>1615 for two days.\n#### 1615", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
