{"question": "Henry caught 7 tunes last Tuesday, the first tune he caught weighs 64 kilograms, the second tune he caught weighs 41 kilograms, and the remaining tune he caught weighs 20 kilograms. If a kilogram of tune costs $1.0, how much will he earn after selling all the tunes to the market?", "answer": "Henry will earn 64*$1 = $<<64*1=64>>64 from the first tune.\nHe will earn 41*$1 = $<<41*1=41>>41 for the second tune.\nThe rest of the tunes are 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5. He will earn 20*$1 = $<<20*1=20>>20 per each of them. So he will earn 5 * 20 = <<5*20>>=100\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunes is $64 + $41 + $100= $<<64+41+100=205>>205.\n#### 205", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
