{"question": "Sophia buys 16 shares of a stock for $28 each. The stock price increases 35% the first year Sophia holds it, then decreases 20% in the second year. What is the final value of all Sophia's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Sophia's purchase: 16 shares * $28/share = $<<16*28=448>>448\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: $448 * 0.35 = $<<448*0.35=156.8>>156\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: $448 + $156.8 = $<<448+156.8=604.8000000000001>>604\nThen multiply that amount by 20% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: $604.8000000000001 * 20% = $<<604.8000000000001*20*.01=120.96000000000002>>120\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: $604 - $120 = $<<604-120=483>>483\n#### 483", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
