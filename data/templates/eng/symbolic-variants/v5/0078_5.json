{"question": "There are 7 periods in the day for a normal student but Alex has to take 1 extra classes. Each class is 45 minutes long. He goes to class for 5 days a week. He then spends 1/5 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 7+1=<<7+1=8>>8 classes a day\nThat means he spends 45*8=<<45*8=360>>360 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 360*5=<<360*5=1800>>1800 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1800*1/5=<<1800*1/5=360>>360 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 1800+360+360=<<1800+360+360=2520>>2520 minutes per week\nSo he spends 2520/60=<<2520/60=42>>42 hours per week\n#### 42", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
