{"question": "Tyler's car breaks down. The car weighs 1000 kilograms and he has luggage in it weighing 325 kilograms. He also has his three young colleagues who weigh 50 kilograms each in it. If the force to move the car is 4% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the car?", "answer": "His three colleagues weigh 50*3=<<50*3=150>>150 kilograms\nSo the total weight of the car and everything is 1000+325+150=<<1000+325+150=1475>>1475 kilograms\nSo he needs to generate 1475*0.04=<<1475*0.04=59>>59 kilograms\n#### 59", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
