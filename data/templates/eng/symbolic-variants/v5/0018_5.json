{"question": "Bob went to buy some school supplies. He bought 16 pencils which cost $10.25 each, 14 folders which cost $16.0 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost $19. How much did Bob spend on everything?", "answer": "Bob spent 16*$10.25 = $<<16*10.25=164>>164 for the pencils.\nHe also spent 14*$16 = $<<14*16=224>>224 for the folders.\nTherefore, Bob spent a total of $164 + $224 + $19 = $<<164+224+19=407>>407 for the school supplies.\n#### 407", "id_orig": 158, "id_shuffled": 18}
