{"question": "I have 10 liters of lemon drink that are half water and I wish to add it to 18 liters of grape drink that is two thirds water. But as I pour it, I spill two liters of the lemon drink. How much water is in the remaining 26 liters?", "answer": "There are 18*2/3 = <<18*2/3=12>>12 liters of water from the 18 liters grape drink.\nAfter two liters of lemon drink was spilled, there were 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 liters of lemon drink left.\nOut of the 8 liters, 8*1/2 = <<8*1/2=4>>4 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 liters of water out of the 26 liters.\n#### 16", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
