{"question": "One miner can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with wooden pickaxe. He can mine twice as much with a nickel pickaxe and 60% more with a bronze pickaxe than with a nickel pickaxe. How many kgs of ore can 20 miners with bronze pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a miner can mine with an nickel pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 kgs/day\nThen multiply that amount by 160% to find how much a miner can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 kgs/day * 160% = <<10*160*.01=16>>16 kgs/day\nThen multiply the amount one miner can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of miners: 16 kgs/day/miner * 20 miners = <<16*20=320>>320 kgs/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 320 kgs/day * 28 days = <<320*28=8960>>8960 kgs/day\n#### 8960", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
