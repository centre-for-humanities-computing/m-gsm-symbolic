{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his sheep. He buys a variety of oats, apples, beets and hay. Since hay are a rare treat, he only buys six 2-pounds boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 8-pounds bags. Oats are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys thirty-eight 55-pounds packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys seventeen 50-pounds sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1500 poundss at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 poundss of hay.\nHe is buying 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 poundss of beets.\nHe is buying 17*50 = <<17*50=850>>850 poundss of apples.\nHe is buying 38*55 = <<38*55=2090>>2090 poundss of oats.\nThe weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 850 + 2090 = <<12+48+850+2090=3000>>3000 poundss.\nThus, the farmer needs 3000 / 1500 = <<3000/1500=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
