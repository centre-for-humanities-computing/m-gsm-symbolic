{"question": "At Michael's house, there are twice as many cannolis as apples. He has a total of 68 apples in his house. Michael bought 62 more apples at the store and 45 fewer cannolis than the number of apples. Find the combined total of the number of cannolis and apples Michael has in the house?", "answer": "Before buying any cannoli and apple, Michael had twice as many cannolis as apples, which is 68 apples*2 cannoli/apple = <<68*2=136>>136 cannolis\nThe total number of cannolis and apples that Michael had before is 136 cannolis + 68 apples = <<136+68=204>>204 items\nWhen he bought 45 fewer cannolis than apples, he bought 62 cannolis - 45 cannolis = <<62-45=17>>17 cannolis\nIn total, he bought 17 cannolis + 62 apples = <<17+62=79>>79 items\nAfter the purchases, Michael has 204 items + 79 items = <<204+79=283>>283 total cannolis and apples combined.\n#### 283", "id_orig": 406, "id_shuffled": 91}
