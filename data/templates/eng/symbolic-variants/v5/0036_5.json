How much was the total cost?", "answer": "The total charge for the danishes was 10*$21 = $<<10*21=210>>210.\nThe total charge for the cookies was 9*$81 = $<<9*81=729>>729.\nThe total charge for the brownies was 8*$117 = $<<8*117=936>>936.\nTherefore the total amount Ellen paid for the desserts was $210 + $729 + $936 = $<<210+729+936=1875>>1875.\n#### 1875", "id_orig": 11, "id_shuffled": 36}
