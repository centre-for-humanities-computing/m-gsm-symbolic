{"question": "Anna's uncle said that she had £240 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of laser tag, have £6 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the bumper cars four times. A round of laser tag is £6. The bumper cars cost £9 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The bumper cars will cost £36 per person because 9*4 = <<9*4=36>>36\nEach person costs £48 because 6 + 6 + 36 = <<6+6+36=48>>48\n5 total people can attend because 240 / 48 = <<240/48=5>>5\nShe can invite 4 friends because 5 - 1 =<<5-1=4>>4\n#### 4", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
