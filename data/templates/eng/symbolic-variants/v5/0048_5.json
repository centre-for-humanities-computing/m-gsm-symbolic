{"question": "Olivia can peel 4 clams a minute and saute 20 clams in 9 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 clams?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Olivia to peel the clams: 60 clams / 4 clams/minute = <<60/4=15>>15 minutes\nThen find how many batches of clams she needs to cook: 60 clams / 20 clams/batch = <<60/20=3>>3 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 9 minutes/batch = <<3*9=27>>27 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Olivia spends: 27 minutes + 15 minutes = <<27+15=42>>42 minutes\n#### 42", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
