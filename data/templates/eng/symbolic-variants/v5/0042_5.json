{"question": "Matt goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs £17 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 45% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 2 kg of rice per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for £4. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The rice he bought was 17*0.45=£<<17*0.45=7>>7 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 17+7=£<<17+7=24>>24 per kg\nHe goes through 2*7=<<2*7=14>>14 kgs of rice a week\nSo he paid 24.65*14=£<<24.65*14=345>>345 on rice\nThat means his total bill was 345+4=£<<345+4=349>>349\n#### 349", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
