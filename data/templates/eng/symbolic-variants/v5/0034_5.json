If he also paid $260,000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment, how much is Dr. Smith's net proceeds from selling the apartment?", "answer": "Dr. Smith paid $880,000*2/100 = $17,600 for the registration fees.\nHe paid $880,000*6/100 = $52,800 for the brokerage fee.\nSo, Dr. Smith paid a total of $17,600 + $52,800 + $260,000 = $330,400 for the registration, brokerage, and loan fees.\nHence, Dr. Smith's net proceeds is $880,000 - $330,400 = $549,600.\n#### 549,600", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
