{"question": "Andrea and Sophie are sisters from New York who love collecting signatures from musicians. During their winter break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 5 weeks, Andrea and Sophie compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Andrea has 30 signatures in her book, and Sophie has 54. The sisters have 3 more weeks of winter break, and they decide they want to reach 145 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Andrea and Sophie have already collected 30 + 54 signatures = <<30+54=84>>84 signatures.\nSince their goal is 145, they need to collect 145 - 84 signatures. 145 - 84 = <<145-84=61>>61 signatures\n#### 61", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
