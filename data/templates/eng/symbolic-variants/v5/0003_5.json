How many like to paint if the number that like to bake is twice the number that prefer playing football?", "answer": "The number of students that like to bake is twice as many as the number who like football, so 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40\nThe number that like to paint is 153 total students - 16 that like to play video games - 20 that like to play football - 40 that like to bake = <<153-16-20-40=77>>77\n#### 77", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
