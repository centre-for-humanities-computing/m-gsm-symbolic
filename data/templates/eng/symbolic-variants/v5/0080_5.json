{"question": "The vending machines sell crackers for 50 cents and popcorn for 80 cents. Joe spent $10 and got 6 bags of crackers and had 6% of his money left in change. How many popcorn did he buy?", "answer": "Joe got $0.6 in change because $10*6/100 = <<10*6/100=0.6>>0.6\nJoe spent $9.4 because 10 - 0.6 = <<10-0.6=9.4>>9.4\nJoe spent $3 on crackers because 6*0.5 = <<6*0.5=3>>3\nJoe spent 6.4 on popcorn because 9.4 - 3 = <<9.4-3=6.4>>6.4\nJoe bought 8 popcorn because 6.4 / 0.8 = <<8=8>>8\n#### 8", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
