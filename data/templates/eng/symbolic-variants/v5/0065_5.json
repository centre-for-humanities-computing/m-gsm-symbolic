{"question": "Ashley is trying to decide whether to do her financial planning herself or hire one accountant. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 6 fewer hours of part-time work, losing €50/hour in missed income. The accountant charges €178. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Ashley does her financial planning herself: €50/hour * 6 hours = €<<50*6=300>>300\nThen subtract the accountant's charge to find how much money Ashley saves: €300 - €178 = €<<300-178=122>>122\n#### 122", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
