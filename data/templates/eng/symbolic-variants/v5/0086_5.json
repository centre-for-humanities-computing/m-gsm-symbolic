{"question": "Olivia qualified for a spot on the basketball team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a jersey for $10, a pair of basketball leggings for $8 more than the jersey cost, and a pair of cleats that were originally $36 but were on sale for one third price. She had a coupon for $1 off the package of $11 athletic headbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The leggings were $8 more than the jersey, so they cost $8 + $10 = $<<8+10=18>>18.\nHer cleats were one third the original $36 price, so they cost $36*1/3=$12.\nWith her coupon, the headbands were $11 - $1 = $<<11-1=10>>10.\nThe jersey, leggings, cleats, and headbands together cost $10 + $18 + $12 + $10 = $<<10+18+12+10=50>>50.\n#### 50", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
