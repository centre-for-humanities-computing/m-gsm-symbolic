{"question": "Ms. Johnson is looking for a apartment that will not go beyond her $330,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $310,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 7% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the apartment than Ms. Johnson's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $310,000*7/100 = $<<310,000*7/100=21,700>>21,700.\nThe transfer fee is $310,000*12/100 = $<<310,000*12/100=37,200>>37,200.\nThe total price of the apartment is $310,000 + $21,700 + $37,200 = $368,900.\nSo, it is $368,900 - $330,000 = $<<368,900-330,000=38,900>>38,900 more than Ms. Johnson's budget.\n#### 38,900", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
