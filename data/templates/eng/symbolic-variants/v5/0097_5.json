{"question": "Maya operates the cash register exactly five times as fast as her less-experienced colleague Sarah. Daily, Sarah processes 75 customers. What is the total weekly production for the two if they work all days of the week?", "answer": "While Sarah is processing 75 orders in a day, Maya processes 75 orders/day*5=<<75*5=375>>375 orders/day.\nIn a day, they process 375 orders/day + 75 orders/day = <<375+75=450>>450 orders together.\nThe total number of orders the two processes in a week is 450 orders/day * 7 days/week = <<450*7=3150>>3150 orders\n#### 3150", "id_orig": 636, "id_shuffled": 97}
