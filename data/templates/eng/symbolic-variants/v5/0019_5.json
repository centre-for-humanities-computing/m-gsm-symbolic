{"question": "In a 120-item quiz, 20% of the questions are economics, and the rest are equally divided as algebra and physics questions. If Anna is sure to get 20% of the economics questions, and one quarter of the algebra and physics questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?", "answer": "The algebra and physics questions comprises 100% - 20% = 80% of the quiz.\nThere are 120 questions*20/100 = <<120*20/100=24>>24 economics questions.\nThere are a total of 120 questions*80/100 = <<120*80/100=96>>96 algebra and physics questions.\nIf Anna is sure to get 20% of the economics questions, then this means she is sure of her 24 questions*20/100 = <<24*20/100=4>>4 points.\nFrom the algebra and physics questions, she is sure to get one quarter of it correctly so that is 96 questions*1/4 = <<96*1/4=24>>24 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 4 points + 24 points = <<4+24=28>>28 points in her quiz.\n#### 28", "id_orig": 1021, "id_shuffled": 19}
