{"question": "Tyler is feeding his livestock feed. Each cow needs 7 pounds, and each llama needs 7 pounds less than twice the amount each cow needs. If there are 42 cows and 29 llamas, how many pounds of feed does Tyler need?", "answer": "First figure out how much feed each llama needs: 7 pounds * 2 - 7 = <<7*2-7=7>>7 pounds/llama\nNow figure out how much feed total the llamas need: 7 pounds/llama * 29 llamas = <<7*29=203>>203 pounds\nNow figure out how much feed total the cows need: 7 pounds/cow * 42 cows = <<7*42=294>>294 pounds\nNow add the two amounts of feed to find the total: 203 pounds + 294 pounds = <<203+294=497>>497 pounds\n#### 497", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
