{"question": "Andrea walks 27 fts every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 12 fts of walking on the beach and 15 ft(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Andrea walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 27-ft walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Andrea walks at a rate of 12 fts per 48 minutes, or 12/48 = 1/4 fts per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/4 = 0.5 fts per minute.\nTo walk 15 ft(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 15/0.5 = <<15/0.5=30>>30 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Andrea 48+30 = <<48+30=78>>78 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 78", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
