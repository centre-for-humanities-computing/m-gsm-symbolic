{"question": "A virus infects eight people. Every day, each infected person infects two others. How many people are infected after three days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original eight people infect two people each, so 8*2 = <<8*2=16>>16 more people are infected.\nThere are 8+16 = <<8+16=24>>24 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 24*2 = <<24*2=48>>48 more people are infected.\nThere are 24 + 48 = <<24+48=72>>72 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 72*2 = 144 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 72 + 144 = 216 infected people after three days.\n#### 216", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
