{"question": "To make a call from a phone booth, you must pay £0.75 for each minute of your call. After 20 minutes, that price drops to £0.25 per minute. How much would a 87-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 20 minutes would be a cost of 20 * 0.75 = £<<20*0.75=15>>15.\nAfter that, there are 87 - 20 = <<87-20=67>>67 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 67 minutes cost 67 * 0.25 = £<<67*0.25=16>>16.\nSo in total, the 87-minute call would cost 15 + 16 = £31.\n#### 31", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
