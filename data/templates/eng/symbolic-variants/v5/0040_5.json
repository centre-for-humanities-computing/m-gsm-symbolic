{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $27 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $1 per pound, get 1 pound 1/3 off.\" She scooped up 7 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.0 and 8 magnets that were $1.75 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $1 and gets 1 pound 1/3 off. So 1/3 off of 1 pound is $1*1/3 = $0.3333333333333333. The rest of 5 pound does not have discount and costs 5*$1 = $5, so total is $1+$2/3+$5=$20/3\n8 magnets at $1.75 each is 8*1.75=$<<8*1.75=14>>14\nWhen you add all her purchases, 20/3+$1+$14 = $<<20/3+1+14=21>>21\nShe had $27 and spent $21 so she had $27-$21 = $<<27-21=6>>6 left over\n#### 6", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
