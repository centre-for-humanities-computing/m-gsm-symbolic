{"question": "Carl wants to make different sized ice cubes with 132 ozs of water. He can make giant cubes that use 8 ozs per cube, medium cubes that use 5 ozs, and small cubes that use 1/5 oz. If he makes 3 giant cubes, 10 medium cubes, and 15 small cubes, how many ozs of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 24 ozs of water because 3 times 8 equals <<3*8=24>>24.\nThe medium cubes used up 50 ozs of water because 10 times 5 equals <<10*5=50>>50.\nThe small cubes used up 3 ozs of water because 15 times 1/5 equals 3.\nThis means that Carl has used up 77 ozs of water because 24 plus 50 plus 3 equals 77.\nCarl has 55 ozs of water left because 132 minus 77 equals <<132-77=55>>55.\n#### 55", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
