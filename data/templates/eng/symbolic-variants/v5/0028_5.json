{"question": "A hospital has a capacity of 1300 beds with 1/10 occupied. Due to the major accident, 30 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/10 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/10 * 1300 = <<1300*1/10=130>>130 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1300 beds - 130 beds = <<1300-130=1170>>1170 beds.\nIf 30 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 30 patients/day * 7 days/week = 210 patients.\nAfter 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 210 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<210*2=420>>420 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 1170 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1170 beds - 420 beds = <<1170-420=750>>750 unoccupied beds.\n#### 750", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
