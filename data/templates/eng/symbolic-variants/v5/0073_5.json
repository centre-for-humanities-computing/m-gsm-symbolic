{"question": "Comet Halley orbits the sun every 60 years. Jason's grandfather saw the Comet when he was 22 years old. Jason saw the comet a second time when he was four times the age his grandfather was when he saw the Comet. How old was Jason when he saw the Comet for the first time?", "answer": "Jason saw the Comet for the second time when he was 22 years * 4= <<22*4=88>>88 years old.\nComet Halley can be seen every 60 years, so Jason saw the comet for the first time when he was 88 years - 60 years = <<88-60=28>>28 years old.\n#### 28", "id_orig": 991, "id_shuffled": 73}
