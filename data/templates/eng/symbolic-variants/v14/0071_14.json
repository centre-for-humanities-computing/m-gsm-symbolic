{"question": "Kenneth is feeding his livestock hay. Each turkey needs 13 pounds, and each pig needs 6 pounds less than twice the amount each turkey needs. If there are 24 turkeys and 38 pigs, how many pounds of hay does Kenneth need?", "answer": "First figure out how much hay each pig needs: 13 pounds * 2 - 6 = <<13*2-6=20>>20 pounds/pig\nNow figure out how much hay total the pigs need: 20 pounds/pig * 38 pigs = <<20*38=760>>760 pounds\nNow figure out how much hay total the turkeys need: 13 pounds/turkey * 24 turkeys = <<13*24=312>>312 pounds\nNow add the two amounts of hay to find the total: 760 pounds + 312 pounds = <<760+312=1072>>1072 pounds\n#### 1072", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
