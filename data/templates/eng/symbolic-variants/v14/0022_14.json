{"question": "Emily was preparing for a lunch party at her house, where she intended to serve creme brulee. She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of 15 new forks and gave them to Emily. While Emily was making the creme brulee, she used six of the forks to sample her creme brulee. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 28 forks. How many forks were in the package that Emily bought?", "answer": "The total number of forks from Emily and her husband was 28+6=<<28+6=34>>34 forks.\nSince the husband bought a package of 15 forks, then Emily's package contained 34-15=<<34-15=19>>19 forks.\n#### 19", "id_orig": 125, "id_shuffled": 22}
