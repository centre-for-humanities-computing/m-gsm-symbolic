{"question": "Tyler has a bag of buttons with 30 inside. He tripped over a rock while carrying it and dropped two thirds of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 8. When he went back home, he inspected the buttons further. Six of the ones he picked up weren't buttons, but actually beads so he got rid of them. How many buttons did Tyler end up with?", "answer": "Tyler dropped his buttons and was left with 30*1/3=<<30*1/3=10>>10 buttons.\nHe searched and found some of his lost buttons, getting him back to 10+8=<<10+8=18>>18 buttons.\nHe went home and removed six beads, leaving him with 18-6=<<18-6=12>>12 buttons.\n#### 12", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
