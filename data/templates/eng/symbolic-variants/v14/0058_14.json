{"question": "One gnome can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with basic shovel. He can mine twice as much with a nickel pickaxe and 35% more with a diamond pickaxe than with a nickel pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 23 gnomes with diamond pickaxes mine in a month with 31 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a gnome can mine with an nickel pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day\nThen multiply that amount by 135% to find how much a gnome can mine with a diamond pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 135% = <<10*135*.01=13>>13 pounds/day\nThen multiply the amount one gnome can mine in a day with a diamond pickaxe by the number of gnomes: 13 pounds/day/gnome * 23 gnomes = <<13*23=310>>310 pounds/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 310 pounds/day * 31 days = <<310*31=9625>>9625 pounds/day\n#### 9625", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
