{"question": "Sarah and Emily are sisters from Dallas who love collecting signatures from politicians. During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 8 weeks, Sarah and Emily compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Sarah has 28 signatures in her book, and Emily has 53. The sisters have 4 more weeks of summer break, and they decide they want to reach 125 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Sarah and Emily have already collected 28 + 53 signatures = <<28+53=81>>81 signatures.\nSince their goal is 125, they need to collect 125 - 81 signatures. 125 - 81 = <<125-81=44>>44 signatures\n#### 44", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
