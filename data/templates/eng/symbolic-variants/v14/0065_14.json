{"question": "Ella is trying to decide whether to do her taxes herself or hire one bookkeeper. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 4 fewer hours of part-time work, losing €43/hour in missed income. The bookkeeper charges €81. How much more money will she have if she hires the bookkeeper?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Ella does her taxes herself: €43/hour * 4 hours = €<<43*4=172>>172\nThen subtract the bookkeeper's charge to find how much money Ella saves: €172 - €81 = €<<172-81=91>>91\n#### 91", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
