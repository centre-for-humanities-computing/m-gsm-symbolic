{"question": "Chris's van breaks down. The van weighs 1900 pounds and he has equipment in it weighing 350 pounds. He also has his three young children who weigh 80 pounds each in it. If the force to move the van is 2% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the van?", "answer": "His three children weigh 80*3=<<80*3=240>>240 pounds\nSo the total weight of the van and everything is 1900+350+240=<<1900+350+240=2490>>2490 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 2490*0.02=<<2490*0.02=49>>49 pounds\n#### 49", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
