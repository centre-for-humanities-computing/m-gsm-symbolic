{"question": "I have 12 liters of apple drink that are two thirds water and I wish to add it to 20 liters of grape drink that is three quarters water. But as I pour it, I spill six liters of the apple drink. How much water is in the remaining 26 liters?", "answer": "There are 20*3/4 = <<20*3/4=15>>15 liters of water from the 20 liters grape drink.\nAfter six liters of apple drink was spilled, there were 12-6 = <<12-6=6>>6 liters of apple drink left.\nOut of the 6 liters, 6*2/3 = <<6*2/3=4>>4 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 15 + 4 = <<15+4=19>>19 liters of water out of the 26 liters.\n#### 19", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
