{"question": "In a set of artist's cards, there are 65 blue cards, and 47% more purple cards. Orange cards are as many as the sum of blue and purple cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 47/100 * 65 = <<47/100*65=30>>30 more purple cards than blue cards.\nWhich means there are 65 + 30 = <<65+30=95>>95 purple cards.\nOrange cards make up to 65 + 95 = <<65+95=160>>160 cards.\nSo in total, there are 160 + 160 = <<160+160=320>>320 cards of different colors.\n#### 320", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
