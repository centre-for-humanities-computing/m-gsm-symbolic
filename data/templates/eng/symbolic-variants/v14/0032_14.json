{"question": "Ms. Johnson is looking for a condo that will not go beyond her $310,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $260,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 7% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 13% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the condo than Ms. Johnson's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $260,000*7/100 = $<<260,000*7/100=18,200>>18,200.\nThe transfer fee is $260,000*13/100 = $<<260,000*13/100=33,800>>33,800.\nThe total price of the condo is $260,000 + $18,200 + $33,800 = $312,000.\nSo, it is $312,000 - $310,000 = $<<312,000-310,000=2000>>2000 more than Ms. Johnson's budget.\n#### 2000", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
