{"question": "If Matt and Noah have 840 meters of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Noah getting 190 meters more than Matt, how much is left over for Matt?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Matt gets and y be the amount Noah gets. We know that y = x + 190, and y + x = 840.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+190=840\nSubtracting the 190 from both sides, we get 2x=650\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=325. This means Matt has 325 meters of fence left over.\n#### 325", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
