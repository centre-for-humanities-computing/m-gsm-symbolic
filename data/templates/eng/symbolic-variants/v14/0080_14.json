How many popcorn did he buy?", "answer": "Matt got $0.6 in change because $10*6/100 = <<10*6/100=0.6>>0.6\nMatt spent $9.4 because 10 - 0.6 = <<10-0.6=9.4>>9.4\nMatt spent $2.8 on cookies because 7*0.4 = <<7*0.4=2.8>>2.8\nMatt spent 6.6000000000000005 on popcorn because 9.4 - 2.8 = <<9.4-2.8=6.6000000000000005>>6.6000000000000005\nMatt bought 12 popcorn because 6.6000000000000005 / 0.55 = <<12=12>>12\n#### 12", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
