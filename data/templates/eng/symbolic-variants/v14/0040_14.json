{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $17 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $4 per pound, get 1 pound 1/6 off.\" She scooped up 3 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $4.0 and 6 magnets that were $0.25 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $4 and gets 1 pound 1/6 off. So 1/6 off of 1 pound is $4*1/6 = $0.6666666666666666. The rest of 1 pound does not have discount and costs 1*$4 = $4, so total is $4+$10/3+$4=$34/3\n6 magnets at $0.25 each is 6*0.25=$<<6*0.25=1.5>>1.5\nWhen you add all her purchases, 34/3+$4+$1.5 = $<<34/3+4+1.5=16>>16\nShe had $17 and spent $16 so she had $17-$16 = $<<17-16=1>>1 left over\n#### 1", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
