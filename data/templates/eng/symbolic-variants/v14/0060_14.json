{"question": "David works a 10-hour shift each day, seven days a week. He earns £25 per hour and gets a £253 bonus each week if the company performs well. How much money did David make in March if the company performed very well for the whole month?", "answer": "In a day, David makes 10 * 25 = £<<10*25=250>>250\nIf he works seven days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 7*4=<<7*4=28>>28 days.\nSince he makes £250 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 28 * 250= £<<28*250=7000>>7000.\nHe also got a 253 * 4 = £<<253*4=1012>>1012 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of March.\nAt the end of March, he earned 7000 + 1012 = £<<7000+1012=8012>>8012.\n#### 8012", "id_orig": 304, "id_shuffled": 60}
