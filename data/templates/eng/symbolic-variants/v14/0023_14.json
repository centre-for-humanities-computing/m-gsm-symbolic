{"question": "Emma is knitting winter wear for her 4 grandchildren. They're quadruplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a shawl, beanie, tunic, mittens, and booties for each of them. It takes 14 skeins of wool to make a shawl, 18 for a beanie, 7 for a tunic, 11 for a pair of mittens, and 8 for a pair of booties. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 14 skeins per shawl + 18 skeins per beanie + 7 skeins per tunic + 11 skeins per pair of mittens + 8 skeins per pair of booties = <<14+18+7+11+8=58>>58 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 4*58 = <<4*58=232>>232 skeins of wool.\n#### 232", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
