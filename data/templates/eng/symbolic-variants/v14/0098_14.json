{"question": "A infection infects thirteen people. Every day, each infected person infects four others. How many people are infected after four days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original thirteen people infect four people each, so 13*4 = <<13*4=52>>52 more people are infected.\nThere are 13+52 = <<13+52=65>>65 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 65*4 = <<65*4=260>>260 more people are infected.\nThere are 65 + 260 = <<65+260=325>>325 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 325*4 = 1300 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 325 + 1300 = 8125 infected people after four days.\n#### 8125", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
