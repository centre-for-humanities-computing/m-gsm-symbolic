{"question": "Emily walks 22 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 6 miles of walking on the beach and 16 mile(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Emily walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 22-mile walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Emily walks at a rate of 6 miles per 66 minutes, or 6/66 = 1/11 miles per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/11 = 0.18181818181818182 miles per minute.\nTo walk 16 mile(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 16/0.18181818181818182 = <<16/0.18181818181818182=88>>88 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Emily 66+88 = <<66+88=154>>154 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 154", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
