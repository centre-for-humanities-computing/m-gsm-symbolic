{"question": "There are 5 periods in the day for a normal student but Joe has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/4 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 classes a day\nThat means he spends 35*8=<<35*8=280>>280 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 280*6=<<280*6=1680>>1680 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1680*1/4=<<1680*1/4=420>>420 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 1680+420+420=<<1680+420+420=2520>>2520 minutes per week\nSo he spends 2520/60=<<2520/60=42>>42 hours per week\n#### 42", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
