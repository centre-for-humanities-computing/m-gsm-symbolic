{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of apples, oats, cucumbers and corns. Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys six 2-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Apples are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys forty-two 70-pound packs. Oats are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys fifteen 60-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1950 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 pounds of corns.\nHe is buying 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 pounds of cucumbers.\nHe is buying 15*60 = <<15*60=900>>900 pounds of oats.\nHe is buying 42*70 = <<42*70=2940>>2940 pounds of apples.\nThe weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 900 + 2940 = <<12+48+900+2940=3900>>3900 pounds.\nThus, the farmer needs 3900 / 1950 = <<3900/1950=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
