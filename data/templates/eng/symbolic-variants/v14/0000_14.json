{"question": "Ethan saw a 20-foot dolphin with 8 3-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 3 inches/remora * 8 remoras = <<3*8=24>>24 inches.\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 24 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<24/12=2>>2 foot.\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 2 foot / 20 feet * 100% = 10%\n\n#### 10", "id_orig": 473, "id_shuffled": 0}
