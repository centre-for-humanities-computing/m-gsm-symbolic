{"question": "Jason watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 6-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 5-hour episodes. If he watched 30 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Thursday.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 30 - 1 = <<30-1=29>>29 hours of TV left.\nAfter Wednesday, he had 29 - 1 = <<29-1=28>>28 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 28 - 6 - 0.75 = 21.25 hours of TV left.\nAfter Saturday, he had 21.25 - 20 = 1.25 hours of TV left.\nEach 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.\nThus, E = 1.25/0.5 = 2.5 episodes.\n#### 2.5", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
