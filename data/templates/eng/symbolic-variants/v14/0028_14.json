{"question": "A clinic has a capacity of 1100 beds with 1/10 occupied. Due to the pandemic, 25 patients are admitted into the clinic each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the clinic after 4 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/10 of the total capacity of the clinic beds is occupied, it means 1/10 * 1100 = <<1100*1/10=110>>110 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the clinic without new admissions is 1100 beds - 110 beds = <<1100-110=990>>990 beds.\nIf 25 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the clinic after one week is 25 patients/day * 7 days/week = 175 patients.\nAfter 4 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the clinic is 175 patients/week * 4 weeks = <<175*4=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 990 unoccupied beds in the clinic before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 990 beds - 700 beds = <<990-700=290>>290 unoccupied beds.\n#### 290", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
