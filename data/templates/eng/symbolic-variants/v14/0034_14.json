{"question": "Mr. Miller sold his house for $800,000. He paid the transfer fees that amount to 2% of the selling price and also paid a agent fee that is 3% of the selling price. If he also paid $470,000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Miller's net proceeds from selling the house?", "answer": "Mr. Miller paid $800,000*2/100 = $16,000 for the transfer fees.\nHe paid $800,000*3/100 = $24,000 for the agent fee.\nSo, Mr. Miller paid a total of $16,000 + $24,000 + $470,000 = $510,000 for the transfer, agent, and loan fees.\nHence, Mr. Miller's net proceeds is $800,000 - $510,000 = $290,000.\n#### 290,000", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
