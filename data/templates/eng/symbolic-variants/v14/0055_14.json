{"question": "Maya is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the hiragana (with 48 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full four times, writes one third of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Maya written in total?", "answer": "Maya has written the hiragana (with 48 letters) four times which is a total of 48*4=<<48*4=192>>192 letters.\nShe then writes one third the hiragana (with 48 letters), which is 48*1/3=<<48*1/3=16>>16 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 192 + 16 = <<192+16=208>>208 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 208 * 2 = <<208*2=416>>416 letters.\n#### 416", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
