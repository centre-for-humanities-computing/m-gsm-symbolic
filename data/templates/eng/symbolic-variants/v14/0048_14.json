{"question": "Emma can peel 12 onions a minute and saute 30 onions in 16 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 60 onions?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Emma to peel the onions: 60 onions / 12 onions/minute = <<60/12=5>>5 minutes\nThen find how many batches of onions she needs to cook: 60 onions / 30 onions/batch = <<60/30=2>>2 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 2 batches * 16 minutes/batch = <<2*16=32>>32 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Emma spends: 32 minutes + 5 minutes = <<32+5=37>>37 minutes\n#### 37", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
