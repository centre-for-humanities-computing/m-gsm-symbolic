{"question": "Matt is selling gingerbread and melon pie for a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold 27 boxes of gingerbread and 7 fewer boxes of melon pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 13 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 21 boxes of melon pie. If the gingerbread cost $9 and the melon pie cost $24, how much did Matt earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 27 + 13 = <<27+13=40>>40 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.\nThe total number of boxes of gingerbread that Matt sold is 27 + 40 = <<27+40=67>>67.\nMatt earned 67*$9 = $<<67*9=603>>603 for selling gingerbread.\nHe sold 21 - 7 = <<21-7=14>>14 boxes of melon pie on Saturday.\nThe total number of boxes of melon pie that Matt sold is 21 + 14 = <<21+14=35>>35.\nHe earned 35*$24 = $<<35*24=840>>840 for selling melon pie.\nSo, Matt earned $603 + $840 = $<<603+840=1443>>1443 for two days.\n#### 1443", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
