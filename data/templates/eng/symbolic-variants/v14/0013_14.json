{"question": "Sophia is an avid gardener. Last night, she received 46 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 50 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 2 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Sophia remain with?", "answer": "Last night, before receiving the plants, Sophia had 2*50 = <<2*50=100>>100 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 46 plants, she therefore had a total of 100 + 46 = <<100+46=146>>146 potted plants\nTomorrow, Sophias plant giveaway will be 50*2 = <<50*2=100>>100 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 146 - 100 = <<146-100=46>>46 potted plants.\n#### 46", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
