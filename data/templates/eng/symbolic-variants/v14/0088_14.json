{"question": "Isabella can run thrice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is one quarter as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends half of the time running and half of the time walking?", "answer": "If Isabella can skip at one quarter the speed she can run, then she can run at 2*4=<<2*4=8>>8 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is thrice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 8/3=2.6666666666666665 miles per hour.\nIf half of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*1/2=<<6*1/2=3>>3 hours.\nIf half of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 hours.\nThus, she runs for 3 hours at 8 miles per hour, or 3*8=<<3*8=24>>24 miles.\nShe walks for 3 hours at 2.6666666666666665 miles per hour, or 3*2.6666666666666665=<<3*2.6666666666666665=8>>8 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 24+8=<<24+8=32>>32 miles.\n#### 32", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
