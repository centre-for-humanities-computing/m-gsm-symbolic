{"question": "To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay £0.75 for each minute of your call. After 12 minutes, that price drops to £0.25 per minute. How much would a 95-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 12 minutes would be a cost of 12 * 0.75 = £<<12*0.75=9>>9.\nAfter that, there are 95 - 12 = <<95-12=83>>83 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 83 minutes cost 83 * 0.25 = £<<83*0.25=20>>20.\nSo in total, the 95-minute call would cost 9 + 20 = £29.\n#### 29", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
