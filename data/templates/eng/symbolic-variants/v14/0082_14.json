{"question": "At the beginning of the party, there were 73 artists and 32 teachers. After two hours, 1/3 of the total number of people left. How many teachers are left if 23 artists stayed at the party?", "answer": "There were a total of 73 artists + 32 teachers = <<73+32=105>>105 people who attended the party.\nAfter two hours, 105 people * 1/3 = <<105*1/3=35>>35 people left the party.\nThis means 105 people - 35 people = <<105-35=70>>70 people stayed.\nOut of the 70 who stayed, 70 people - 23 artists = <<70-23=47>>47 were teachers.\n#### 47", "id_orig": 320, "id_shuffled": 82}
