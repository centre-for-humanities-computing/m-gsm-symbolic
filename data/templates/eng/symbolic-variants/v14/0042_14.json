{"question": "Chris goes to the store to buy some sugar. The normal brand of sugar he buys costs $22 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 25% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses 1 kilogram of sugar per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for $4. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The sugar he bought was 22*0.25=$<<22*0.25=5>>5 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 22+5=$<<22+5=27>>27 per kilogram\nHe goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kilograms of sugar a week\nSo he paid 27.5*7=$<<27.5*7=192>>192 on sugar\nThat means his total bill was 192+4=$<<192+4=196>>196\n#### 196", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
