{"question": "In Ms. Johnson's class of 78 students, 38% of the class are basketball players. Out of the remaining class, 31% of the students are debate team members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "38% of the 78 student class are basketball players so that's 0.38*78 = <<0.38*78=29>>29 students\nThere are 78 students and 29 are basketball players so that leaves 78-29 = <<78-29=49>>49 students\n31% of the remaining 49 students are part of dancers or debate team members so that's 0.31*49 = <<0.31*49=15>>15 students\n29 students are basketball players and 15 are part of dancers/debate team members so 29+15 = <<29+15=44>>44 students will be leaving early\n#### 44", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
