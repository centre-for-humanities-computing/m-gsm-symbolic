{"question": "Joshua wants to make different sized ice cubes with 140 pounds of water. He can make giant cubes that use 9 pounds per cube, medium cubes that use 7 pounds, and small cubes that use 1/6 pound. If he makes 4 giant cubes, 10 medium cubes, and 24 small cubes, how many pounds of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 36 pounds of water because 4 times 9 equals <<4*9=36>>36.\nThe medium cubes used up 70 pounds of water because 10 times 7 equals <<10*7=70>>70.\nThe small cubes used up 4 pounds of water because 24 times 1/6 equals 4.\nThis means that Joshua has used up 110 pounds of water because 36 plus 70 plus 4 equals 110.\nJoshua has 30 pounds of water left because 140 minus 110 equals <<140-110=30>>30.\n#### 30", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
