{"question": "When Emma watches her cousin, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 47 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 17 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 19 multicolored rings on it. Emma recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her cousin up to 138. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Emma has 47 + 17 + 19 + T = 83 + T = 138 toys for her cousin.\nThus, T = 138 - 83 = <<138-83=55>>55 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 55", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
