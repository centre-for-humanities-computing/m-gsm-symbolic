{"question": "Joshua caught 4 cods last Saturday, the first cod he caught weighs 68 kgs, the second cod he caught weighs 51 kgs, and the remaining cod he caught weighs 26 kgs. If a kg of cod costs €0.25, how much will he earn after selling all the cods to the market?", "answer": "Joshua will earn 68*€0.25 = €<<68*0.25=17>>17 from the first cod.\nHe will earn 51*€0.25 = €<<51*0.25=12.75>>12.75 for the second cod.\nThe rest of the cods are 4-2 = <<4-2=2>>2. He will earn 26*€0.25 = €<<26*0.25=6.5>>6.5 per each of them. So he will earn 2 * 6.5 = <<2*6.5>>=13\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the cods is €17 + €12.75 + €13= €<<17+12.75+13=42>>42.\n#### 42", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
