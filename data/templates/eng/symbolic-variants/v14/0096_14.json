{"question": "Emily's uncle said that she had £300 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of bowling, have £6 in game room tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of bowling is £4. The go-karts cost £10 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The go-karts will cost £20 per person because 10*2 = <<10*2=20>>20\nEach person costs £30 because 6 + 4 + 20 = <<6+4+20=30>>30\n10 total people can attend because 300 / 30 = <<300/30=10>>10\nShe can invite 9 friends because 10 - 1 =<<10-1=9>>9\n#### 9", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
