{"question": "A class of 194 students has various hobbies. 20 like to play video games, 40 like to play golf, and the rest like to either dance or hike. How many like to dance if the number that like to hike is twice the number that prefer playing golf?", "answer": "The number of students that like to hike is twice as many as the number who like golf, so 2 * 40 = <<2*40=80>>80\nThe number that like to dance is 194 total students - 20 that like to play video games - 40 that like to play golf - 80 that like to hike = <<194-20-40-80=54>>54\n#### 54", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
