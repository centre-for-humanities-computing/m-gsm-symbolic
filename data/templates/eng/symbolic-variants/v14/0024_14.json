{"question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 400 calories per serving. If a 125 oz bag has 5 servings, how many ozs can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2100 and you have already consumed 850 calories?", "answer": "If the total calorie target is 2100 and I have consumed 850 calories then I have 2100-850 = <<2100-850=1250>>1250 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of cookies has 400 calories and I only have 1250 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 1250/400 of a serving = 25/8 of a serving\nWe also know that a 125 oz bag of cookies has 5 servings, hence each serving has 125 oz/5 = <<125/5=25>>25 ozs\nIf I can only eat 25/8 of a serving, then I can eat only 25 oz * 25/8 = 78.125 ozs\n#### 78.125", "id_orig": 43, "id_shuffled": 24}
