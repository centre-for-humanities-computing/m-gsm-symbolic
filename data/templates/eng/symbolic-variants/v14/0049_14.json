{"question": "Lucas collects garbage from 7 different apartment complexes. The first six have 350 apartments each and the last one is 45% bigger than the other six combined. He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid £0.2 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first six complexes have 6*350=<<6*350=2100>>2100 apartments\nNumber 7 has 2100*0.45=<<2100*0.45=945>>945 more apartments than those six combined.\nSo in total, it has 2100+945=<<2100+945=3045>>3045 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 3045+2100=<<3045+2100=5145>>5145 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 5145*3=<<5145*3=15,435>>15,435 apartments every week\nSo he makes 15,435*£0.2=£<<15,435*0.2=3087>>3087 every week\n#### 3087", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
