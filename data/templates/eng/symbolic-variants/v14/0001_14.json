{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 57 minutes to cover every 84 miles of the city. If the city is 68 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 68/84 = <<68/84=0>>0 intervals of 57 minutes.\nThus, it will take 0 * 57 = <<0*57=0>>0 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 0", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
