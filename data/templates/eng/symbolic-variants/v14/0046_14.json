{"question": "Sunnyside High is holding graduation in their Gymnasium this year which has space for 7600 people. After accounting for 850 seats for graduates and 150 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?", "answer": "Add graduate and faculty seats together. 850 + 150 = <<850+150=1000>>1000 seats for faculty and graduates\nMinus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 7600 - 1000 = <<7600-1000=6600>>6600 remaining seats.\nDivide remaining seats by the number of graduates. 6600/850 = <<6600/850=7>>7 tickets\n#### 7", "id_orig": 1031, "id_shuffled": 46}
