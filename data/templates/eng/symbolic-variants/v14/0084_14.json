{"question": "Olivia buys 17 shares of a stock for £40 each. The stock price increases 35% the first year Olivia holds it, then decreases 30% in the second year. What is the final value of all Olivia's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Olivia's purchase: 17 shares * £40/share = £<<17*40=680>>680\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: £680 * 0.35 = £<<680*0.35=238>>238\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: £680 + £238 = £<<680+238=918.0000000000001>>918\nThen multiply that amount by 30% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: £918.0000000000001 * 30% = £<<918.0000000000001*30*.01=275.40000000000003>>275\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: £918 - £275 = £<<918-275=642>>642\n#### 642", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
