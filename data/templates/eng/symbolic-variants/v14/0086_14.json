{"question": "Emma qualified for a spot on the swimming team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a sports bra for €19, a pair of swimming shorts for €5 more than the sports bra cost, and a pair of sneakers that were originally €48 but were on sale for three quarters price. She had a coupon for €1 off the package of €11 athletic headbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The shorts were €5 more than the sports bra, so they cost €5 + €19 = €<<5+19=24>>24.\nHer sneakers were three quarters the original €48 price, so they cost €48*3/4=€36.\nWith her coupon, the headbands were €11 - €1 = €<<11-1=10>>10.\nThe sports bra, shorts, sneakers, and headbands together cost €19 + €24 + €36 + €10 = €<<19+24+36+10=89>>89.\n#### 89", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
