{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of oats, hay, carrots and wheats. Since wheats are a rare treat, he only buys six 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys eight 8-pound bags. Oats are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys forty-two 65-pound packs. Hay are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys sixteen 50-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1800 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 6*1 = <<6*1=6>>6 pounds of wheats.\nHe is buying 8*8 = <<8*8=64>>64 pounds of carrots.\nHe is buying 16*50 = <<16*50=800>>800 pounds of hay.\nHe is buying 42*65 = <<42*65=2730>>2730 pounds of oats.\nThe weight of all the feed is 6 + 64 + 800 + 2730 = <<6+64+800+2730=3600>>3600 pounds.\nThus, the farmer needs 3600 / 1800 = <<3600/1800=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
