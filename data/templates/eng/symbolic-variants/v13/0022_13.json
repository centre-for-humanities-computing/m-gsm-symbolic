{"question": "Ellen was preparing for a game night at her house, where she intended to serve creme brulee. She noticed that she was out of plastic plates, so she bought a new package of plates. Later, her husband also bought a package of 15 new plates and gave them to Ellen. While Ellen was making the creme brulee, she used five of the plates to sample her creme brulee. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 16 plates. How many plates were in the package that Ellen bought?", "answer": "The total number of plates from Ellen and her husband was 16+5=<<16+5=21>>21 plates.\nSince the husband bought a package of 15 plates, then Ellen's package contained 21-15=<<21-15=6>>6 plates.\n#### 6", "id_orig": 125, "id_shuffled": 22}
