On Friday, he sold 14 more boxes of muffins than on Thursday and 26 boxes of blueberry pie. If the muffins cost £13 and the blueberry pie cost £30, how much did Matt earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 27 + 14 = <<27+14=41>>41 boxes of muffins on Friday.\nThe total number of boxes of muffins that Matt sold is 27 + 41 = <<27+41=68>>68.\nMatt earned 68*£13 = £<<68*13=884>>884 for selling muffins.\nHe sold 26 - 14 = <<26-14=12>>12 boxes of blueberry pie on Thursday.\nThe total number of boxes of blueberry pie that Matt sold is 26 + 12 = <<26+12=38>>38.\nHe earned 38*£30 = £<<38*30=1140>>1140 for selling blueberry pie.\nSo, Matt earned £884 + £1140 = £<<884+1140=2024>>2024 for two days.\n#### 2024", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
