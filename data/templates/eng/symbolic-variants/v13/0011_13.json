{"question": "Ethan wants to make different sized ice cubes with 100 ozs of water. He can make giant cubes that use 5 ozs per cube, medium cubes that use 4 ozs, and small cubes that use 1/4 oz. If he makes 4 giant cubes, 12 medium cubes, and 24 small cubes, how many ozs of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 20 ozs of water because 4 times 5 equals <<4*5=20>>20.\nThe medium cubes used up 48 ozs of water because 12 times 4 equals <<12*4=48>>48.\nThe small cubes used up 6 ozs of water because 24 times 1/4 equals 6.\nThis means that Ethan has used up 74 ozs of water because 20 plus 48 plus 6 equals 74.\nEthan has 26 ozs of water left because 100 minus 74 equals <<100-74=26>>26.\n#### 26", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
