{"question": "Sophia buys 5 shares of a stock for $27 each. The stock price increases 40% the first year Sophia holds it, then decreases 5% in the second year. What is the final value of all Sophia's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Sophia's purchase: 5 shares * $27/share = $<<5*27=135>>135\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: $135 * 0.4 = $<<135*0.4=54>>54\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: $135 + $54 = $<<135+54=189>>189\nThen multiply that amount by 5% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: $189 * 5% = $<<189*5*.01=9.45>>9\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: $189 - $9 = $<<189-9=179>>179\n#### 179", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
