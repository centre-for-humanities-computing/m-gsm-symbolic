{"question": "Emily went to the patisserie and bought various types of pastries. She bought 9 dozen eclairs which cost $12 per dozen, 9 dozen tarts which cost $77 per dozen, and 9 dozen mini cheesecakes for $116 per dozen. How much was the total cost?", "answer": "The total charge for the eclairs was 9*$12 = $<<9*12=108>>108.\nThe total charge for the tarts was 9*$77 = $<<9*77=693>>693.\nThe total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 9*$116 = $<<9*116=1044>>1044.\nTherefore the total amount Emily paid for the pastries was $108 + $693 + $1044 = $<<108+693+1044=1845>>1845.\n#### 1845", "id_orig": 11, "id_shuffled": 36}
