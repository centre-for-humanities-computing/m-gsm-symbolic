{"question": "There are 5 periods in the day for a normal student but Henry has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 30 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/3 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 classes a day\nThat means he spends 30*8=<<30*8=240>>240 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 240*6=<<240*6=1440>>1440 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1440*1/3=<<1440*1/3=480>>480 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 1440+480+480=<<1440+480+480=2400>>2400 minutes per week\nSo he spends 2400/60=<<2400/60=40>>40 hours per week\n#### 40", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
