{"question": "In a set of chef's cards, there are 56 orange cards, and 75% more purple cards. Yellow cards are as many as the sum of orange and purple cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 75/100 * 56 = <<75/100*56=42>>42 more purple cards than orange cards.\nWhich means there are 56 + 42 = <<56+42=98>>98 purple cards.\nYellow cards make up to 56 + 98 = <<56+98=154>>154 cards.\nSo in total, there are 154 + 154 = <<154+154=308>>308 cards of different colors.\n#### 308", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
