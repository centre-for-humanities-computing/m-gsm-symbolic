{"question": "Emily is an avid gardener. Last night, she received 34 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 6 potted plants on each of the 48 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 2 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Emily remain with?", "answer": "Last night, before receiving the plants, Emily had 6*48 = <<6*48=288>>288 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 34 plants, she therefore had a total of 288 + 34 = <<288+34=322>>322 potted plants\nTomorrow, Emilys plant giveaway will be 48*2 = <<48*2=96>>96 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 322 - 96 = <<322-96=226>>226 potted plants.\n#### 226", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
