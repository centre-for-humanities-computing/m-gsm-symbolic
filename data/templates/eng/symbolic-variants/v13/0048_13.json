{"question": "Jessica can peel 4 onions a minute and saute 40 onions in 14 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 160 onions?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Jessica to peel the onions: 160 onions / 4 onions/minute = <<160/4=40>>40 minutes\nThen find how many batches of onions she needs to cook: 160 onions / 40 onions/batch = <<160/40=4>>4 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 4 batches * 14 minutes/batch = <<4*14=56>>56 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Jessica spends: 56 minutes + 40 minutes = <<56+40=96>>96 minutes\n#### 96", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
