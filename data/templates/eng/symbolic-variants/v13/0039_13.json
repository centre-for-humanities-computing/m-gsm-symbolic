{"question": "A janitor has to clean a office building with 120 rooms. They have 10 days to get it done. It takes them 20 minutes per room. If they work 8 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?", "answer": "They have to clean 12 rooms a day because 120 / 10 = <<120/10=12>>12\nThey spend 240 minutes cleaning per day because 12*20 = <<12*20=240>>240\nThey spend 4 hours a day because 240 / 60 = <<240/60=4>>4\nThey spend 1/2 of their day cleaning rooms because 4 / 8 = <<4/8=0.5>>0.5\nThey spend 50% of their day cleaning rooms because 0.5*100 = <<0.5*100=50>>50\n#### 50", "id_orig": 1239, "id_shuffled": 39}
