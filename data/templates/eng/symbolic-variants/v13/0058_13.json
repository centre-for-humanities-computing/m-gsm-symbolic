{"question": "One miner can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with basic shovel. He can mine twice as much with a silver pickaxe and 60% more with a bronze pickaxe than with a silver pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 21 miners with bronze pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a miner can mine with an silver pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day\nThen multiply that amount by 160% to find how much a miner can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 160% = <<10*160*.01=16>>16 pounds/day\nThen multiply the amount one miner can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of miners: 16 pounds/day/miner * 21 miners = <<16*21=336>>336 pounds/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 336 pounds/day * 28 days = <<336*28=9408>>9408 pounds/day\n#### 9408", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
