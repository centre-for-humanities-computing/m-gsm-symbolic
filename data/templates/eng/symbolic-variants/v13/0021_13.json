{"question": "Tyler watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Thursday and Friday, he watched a 3-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Saturday, he watched a few episodes of a 60-minute show. On Sunday, he finished homework early and watched a 5-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Monday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 3-hour episodes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Saturday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Saturday.\nAfter Thursday, he had 20 - 3 = <<20-3=17>>17 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 17 - 3 = <<17-3=14>>14 hours of TV left.\nAfter Sunday, he had 14 - 5 - 0.5 = 8.5 hours of TV left.\nAfter Monday, he had 8.5 - 6 = 2.5 hours of TV left.\nEach 60-minute episode is 1 hour.\nThus, E = 2.5/1 = 2.5 episodes.\n#### 2.5", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
