{"question": "Dr. Patel is looking for a townhouse that will not go beyond her $470,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $420,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 10% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the townhouse than Dr. Patel's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $420,000*3/100 = $<<420,000*3/100=12,600>>12,600.\nThe transfer fee is $420,000*10/100 = $<<420,000*10/100=42,000>>42,000.\nThe total price of the townhouse is $420,000 + $12,600 + $42,000 = $474,600.\nSo, it is $474,600 - $470,000 = $<<474,600-470,000=4600>>4600 more than Dr. Patel's budget.\n#### 4600", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
