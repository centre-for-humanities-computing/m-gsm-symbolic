{"question": "Chris collects garbage from 7 different apartment complexes. The first six have 150 apartments each and the last one is 45% bigger than the other six combined. He collects garbage 4 times a week from each place and he gets paid $0.35000000000000003 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first six complexes have 6*150=<<6*150=900>>900 apartments\nNumber 7 has 900*0.45=<<900*0.45=405>>405 more apartments than those six combined.\nSo in total, it has 900+405=<<900+405=1305>>1305 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 1305+900=<<1305+900=2205>>2205 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 2205*4=<<2205*4=8820>>8820 apartments every week\nSo he makes 8820*$0.35000000000000003=$<<8820*0.35000000000000003=3087>>3087 every week\n#### 3087", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
