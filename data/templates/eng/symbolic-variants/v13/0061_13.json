{"question": "Eric has a bag of beads with 42 inside. He tripped over a toy while carrying it and dropped two thirds of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 19. When he went back home, he inspected the beads further. Six of the ones he picked up weren't beads, but actually buttons so he got rid of them. How many beads did Eric end up with?", "answer": "Eric dropped his beads and was left with 42*1/3=<<42*1/3=14>>14 beads.\nHe searched and found some of his lost beads, getting him back to 14+19=<<14+19=33>>33 beads.\nHe went home and removed six buttons, leaving him with 33-6=<<33-6=27>>27 beads.\n#### 27", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
