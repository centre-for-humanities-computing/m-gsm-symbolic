{"question": "Amanda and Sophie are sisters from Dallas who love collecting signatures from musicians. During their winter break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Amanda and Sophie compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Amanda has 33 signatures in her book, and Sophie has 33. The sisters have 4 more weeks of winter break, and they decide they want to reach 140 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Amanda and Sophie have already collected 33 + 33 signatures = <<33+33=66>>66 signatures.\nSince their goal is 140, they need to collect 140 - 66 signatures. 140 - 66 = <<140-66=74>>74 signatures\n#### 74", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
