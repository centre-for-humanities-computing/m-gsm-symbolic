{"question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 275 calories per serving. If a 275 oz bag has 5 servings, how many ozs can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2350 and you have already consumed 975 calories?", "answer": "If the total calorie target is 2350 and I have consumed 975 calories then I have 2350-975 = <<2350-975=1375>>1375 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of cookies has 275 calories and I only have 1375 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 1375/275 of a serving = 5 of a serving\nWe also know that a 275 oz bag of cookies has 5 servings, hence each serving has 275 oz/5 = <<275/5=55>>55 ozs\nIf I can only eat 5 of a serving, then I can eat only 55 oz * 5 = 275 ozs\n#### 275", "id_orig": 43, "id_shuffled": 24}
