{"question": "Ella is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 100 pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then two times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next 30 seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Ella takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Ella have to eat?", "answer": "In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 2*100=<<2*100=200>>200 kernels pop.\nIn the third 30 seconds, 4*100=<<4*100=400>>400 kernels pop.\nIn the final 30 seconds, 400 / 2 = <<400/2=200>>200 kernels pop.\nAfter cooking, the residual heat makes 200 / 4 = <<200/4=50>>50 kernels pop.\nThus, Ella has 100 + 200 + 400 + 200 + 50 = <<100+200+400+200+50=950>>950 pieces of popcorn to eat.\n#### 950", "id_orig": 1264, "id_shuffled": 4}
