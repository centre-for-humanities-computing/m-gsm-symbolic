{"question": "I have 14 liters of mango drink that are two thirds water and I wish to add it to 25 liters of peach drink that is one fifth water. But as I pour it, I spill five liters of the mango drink. How much water is in the remaining 34 liters?", "answer": "There are 25*1/5 = <<25*1/5=5>>5 liters of water from the 25 liters peach drink.\nAfter five liters of mango drink was spilled, there were 14-5 = <<14-5=9>>9 liters of mango drink left.\nOut of the 9 liters, 9*2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 5 + 6 = <<5+6=11>>11 liters of water out of the 34 liters.\n#### 11", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
