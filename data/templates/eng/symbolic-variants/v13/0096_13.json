{"question": "Ava's dad said that she had €190 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of bowling, have €3 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the bumper cars thrice. A round of bowling is €8. The bumper cars cost €9 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The bumper cars will cost €27 per person because 9*3 = <<9*3=27>>27\nEach person costs €38 because 3 + 8 + 27 = <<3+8+27=38>>38\n5 total people can attend because 190 / 38 = <<190/38=5>>5\nShe can invite 4 friends because 5 - 1 =<<5-1=4>>4\n#### 4", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
