{"question": "Joshua's van breaks down. The van weighs 1700 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 425 pounds. He also has his four young children who weigh 85 pounds each in it. If the force to move the van is 1% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the van?", "answer": "His four children weigh 85*4=<<85*4=340>>340 pounds\nSo the total weight of the van and everything is 1700+425+340=<<1700+425+340=2465>>2465 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 2465*0.01=<<2465*0.01=24>>24 pounds\n#### 24", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
