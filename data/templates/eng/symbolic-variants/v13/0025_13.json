{"question": "In Dr. Lee's class of 108 students, 37% of the class are basketball players. Out of the remaining class, 22% of the students are dancers or part of debate team members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away performance. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "37% of the 108 student class are basketball players so that's 0.37*108 = <<0.37*108=39>>39 students\nThere are 108 students and 39 are basketball players so that leaves 108-39 = <<108-39=69>>69 students\n22% of the remaining 69 students are part of debate team members or dancers so that's 0.22*69 = <<0.22*69=15>>15 students\n39 students are basketball players and 15 are part of debate team members/dancers so 39+15 = <<39+15=55>>55 students will be leaving early\n#### 55", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
