{"question": "The vending machines sell cookies for 75 cents and popcorn for 80 cents. Alex spent $10 and got 4 bags of cookies and had 6% of his money left in change. How many popcorn did he buy?", "answer": "Alex got $0.6 in change because $10*6/100 = <<10*6/100=0.6>>0.6\nAlex spent $9.4 because 10 - 0.6 = <<10-0.6=9.4>>9.4\nAlex spent $3 on cookies because 4*0.75 = <<4*0.75=3>>3\nAlex spent 6.4 on popcorn because 9.4 - 3 = <<9.4-3=6.4>>6.4\nAlex bought 8 popcorn because 6.4 / 0.8 = <<8=8>>8\n#### 8", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
