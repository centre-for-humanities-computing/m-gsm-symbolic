{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 400 minutes to cover every 55 miles of the city. If the city is 87 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 87/55 = <<87/55=1>>1 intervals of 400 minutes.\nThus, it will take 1 * 400 = <<1*400=400>>400 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 400", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
