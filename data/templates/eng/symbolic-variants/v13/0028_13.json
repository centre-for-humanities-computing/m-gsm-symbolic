{"question": "A hospital has a capacity of 1800 beds with 1/5 occupied. Due to the pandemic, 60 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1800 = <<1800*1/5=360>>360 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1800 beds - 360 beds = <<1800-360=1440>>1440 beds.\nIf 60 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 60 patients/day * 7 days/week = 420 patients.\nAfter 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 420 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<420*2=840>>840 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 1440 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1440 beds - 840 beds = <<1440-840=600>>600 unoccupied beds.\n#### 600", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
