How many like to hike if the number that like to read is twice the number that prefer playing golf?", "answer": "The number of students that like to read is twice as many as the number who like golf, so 2 * 31 = <<2*31=62>>62\nThe number that like to hike is 184 total students - 58 that like to play music - 31 that like to play golf - 62 that like to read = <<184-58-31-62=33>>33\n#### 33", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
