{"question": "Ella is trying to decide whether to do her business accounting herself or hire one accountant. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 6 fewer hours of freelance work, losing €99/hour in missed income. The accountant charges €128. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Ella does her business accounting herself: €99/hour * 6 hours = €<<99*6=594>>594\nThen subtract the accountant's charge to find how much money Ella saves: €594 - €128 = €<<594-128=466>>466\n#### 466", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
