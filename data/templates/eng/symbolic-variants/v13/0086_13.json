{"question": "Claire qualified for a spot on the soccer team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a t-shirt for £12, a pair of soccer sweatpants for £9 more than the t-shirt cost, and a pair of cleats that were originally £78 but were on sale for one third price. She had a coupon for £2 off the package of £5 athletic wristbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The sweatpants were £9 more than the t-shirt, so they cost £9 + £12 = £<<9+12=21>>21.\nHer cleats were one third the original £78 price, so they cost £78*1/3=£26.\nWith her coupon, the wristbands were £5 - £2 = £<<5-2=3>>3.\nThe t-shirt, sweatpants, cleats, and wristbands together cost £12 + £21 + £26 + £3 = £<<12+21+26+3=62>>62.\n#### 62", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
