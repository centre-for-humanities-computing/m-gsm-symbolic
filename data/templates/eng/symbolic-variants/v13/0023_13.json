{"question": "Claire is knitting winter wear for her 4 grandchildren. They're quadruplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a cardigan, vest, poncho, gloves, and mittens for each of them. It takes 7 skeins of wool to make a cardigan, 12 for a vest, 10 for a poncho, 11 for a pair of gloves, and 16 for a pair of mittens. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 7 skeins per cardigan + 12 skeins per vest + 10 skeins per poncho + 11 skeins per pair of gloves + 16 skeins per pair of mittens = <<7+12+10+11+16=56>>56 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 4*56 = <<4*56=224>>224 skeins of wool.\n#### 224", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
