{"question": "If Eric and Joe have 240 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Joe getting 190 feet more than Eric, how much is left over for Eric?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Eric gets and y be the amount Joe gets. We know that y = x + 190, and y + x = 240.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+190=240\nSubtracting the 190 from both sides, we get 2x=50\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=25. This means Eric has 25 feet of fence left over.\n#### 25", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
