{"question": "Carl goes to the store to buy some rice. The normal brand of rice he buys costs €13 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 35% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 3 kg of rice per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for €2. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The rice he bought was 13*0.35=€<<13*0.35=4>>4 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 13+4=€<<13+4=17>>17 per kg\nHe goes through 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 kgs of rice a week\nSo he paid 17.55*21=€<<17.55*21=368>>368 on rice\nThat means his total bill was 368+2=€<<368+2=370>>370\n#### 370", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
