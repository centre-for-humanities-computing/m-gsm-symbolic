{"question": "Bob caught 4 trouts last Saturday, the first trout he caught weighs 75 pounds, the second trout he caught weighs 35 pounds, and the remaining trout he caught weighs 30 pounds. If a pound of trout costs $1.75, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?", "answer": "Bob will earn 75*$1.75 = $<<75*1.75=131.25>>131.25 from the first trout.\nHe will earn 35*$1.75 = $<<35*1.75=61.25>>61.25 for the second trout.\nThe rest of the trouts are 4-2 = <<4-2=2>>2. He will earn 30*$1.75 = $<<30*1.75=52.5>>52.5 per each of them. So he will earn 2 * 52.5 = <<2*52.5>>=105\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is $131.25 + $61.25 + $105= $<<131.25+61.25+105=297>>297.\n#### 297", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
