What percent of her spools are blue?", "answer": "First find the number of blue spools: 55 spools + 105 spools = <<55+105=160>>160 spools\nThen find the total number of spools: 40 spools + 50 spools + 160 spools = <<40+50+160=250>>250 spools\nThen divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 160 spools / 250 spools * 100% = 64%\n#### 64", "id_orig": 728, "id_shuffled": 66}
