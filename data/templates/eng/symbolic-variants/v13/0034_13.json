{"question": "Prof. Smith sold his cottage for $450,000. He paid the legal fees that amount to 4% of the selling price and also paid a agent fee that is 6% of the selling price. If he also paid $220,000 for the remaining loan amount of the cottage, how much is Prof. Smith's net proceeds from selling the cottage?", "answer": "Prof. Smith paid $450,000*4/100 = $18,000 for the legal fees.\nHe paid $450,000*6/100 = $27,000 for the agent fee.\nSo, Prof. Smith paid a total of $18,000 + $27,000 + $220,000 = $265,000 for the legal, agent, and loan fees.\nHence, Prof. Smith's net proceeds is $450,000 - $265,000 = $185,000.\n#### 185,000", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
