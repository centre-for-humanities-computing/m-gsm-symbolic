{"question": "To make a call from a phone booth, you must pay €0.5 for each minute of your call. After 39 minutes, that price drops to €0.25 per minute. How much would a 69-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 39 minutes would be a cost of 39 * 0.5 = €<<39*0.5=19>>19.\nAfter that, there are 69 - 39 = <<69-39=30>>30 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 30 minutes cost 30 * 0.25 = €<<30*0.25=7>>7.\nSo in total, the 69-minute call would cost 19 + 7 = €26.\n#### 27", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
