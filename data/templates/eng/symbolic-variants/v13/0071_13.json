{"question": "Ethan is feeding his livestock silage. Each horse needs 13 kilograms, and each alpaca needs 4 kilograms less than twice the amount each horse needs. If there are 28 horses and 32 alpacas, how many kilograms of silage does Ethan need?", "answer": "First figure out how much silage each alpaca needs: 13 kilograms * 2 - 4 = <<13*2-4=22>>22 kilograms/alpaca\nNow figure out how much silage total the alpacas need: 22 kilograms/alpaca * 32 alpacas = <<22*32=704>>704 kilograms\nNow figure out how much silage total the horses need: 13 kilograms/horse * 28 horses = <<13*28=364>>364 kilograms\nNow add the two amounts of silage to find the total: 704 kilograms + 364 kilograms = <<704+364=1068>>1068 kilograms\n#### 1068", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
