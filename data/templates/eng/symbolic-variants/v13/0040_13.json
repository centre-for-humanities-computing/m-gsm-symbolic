{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $32 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $1 per pound, get 1 pound 1/5 off.\" She scooped up 3 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.0 and 10 magnets that were $2.5 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $1 and gets 1 pound 1/5 off. So 1/5 off of 1 pound is $1*1/5 = $0.2. The rest of 1 pound does not have discount and costs 1*$1 = $1, so total is $1+$4/5+$1=$14/5\n10 magnets at $2.5 each is 10*2.5=$<<10*2.5=25>>25\nWhen you add all her purchases, 14/5+$1+$25 = $<<14/5+1+25=28>>28\nShe had $32 and spent $28 so she had $32-$28 = $<<32-28=4>>4 left over\n#### 4", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
