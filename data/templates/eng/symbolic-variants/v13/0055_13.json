{"question": "Sophie is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the arabic abjad (with 28 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full five times, writes one quarter of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Sophie written in total?", "answer": "Sophie has written the arabic abjad (with 28 letters) five times which is a total of 28*5=<<28*5=140>>140 letters.\nShe then writes one quarter the arabic abjad (with 28 letters), which is 28*1/4=<<28*1/4=7>>7 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 140 + 7 = <<140+7=147>>147 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 147 * 2 = <<147*2=294>>294 letters.\n#### 294", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
