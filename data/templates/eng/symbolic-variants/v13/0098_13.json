{"question": "A virus infects eight people. Every day, each infected person infects four others. How many people are infected after three days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original eight people infect four people each, so 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 more people are infected.\nThere are 8+32 = <<8+32=40>>40 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 40*4 = <<40*4=160>>160 more people are infected.\nThere are 40 + 160 = <<40+160=200>>200 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 200*4 = 800 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 200 + 800 = 1000 infected people after three days.\n#### 1000", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
