{"question": "At the beginning of the conference, there were 73 teachers and 32 lawyers. After two hours, 1/3 of the total number of people left. How many lawyers are left if 32 teachers stayed at the conference?", "answer": "There were a total of 73 teachers + 32 lawyers = <<73+32=105>>105 people who attended the conference.\nAfter two hours, 105 people * 1/3 = <<105*1/3=35>>35 people left the conference.\nThis means 105 people - 35 people = <<105-35=70>>70 people stayed.\nOut of the 70 who stayed, 70 people - 32 teachers = <<70-32=38>>38 were lawyers.\n#### 38", "id_orig": 320, "id_shuffled": 82}
