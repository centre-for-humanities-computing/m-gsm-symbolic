{"question": "Sophia can run thrice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is one third as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?", "answer": "If Sophia can skip at one third the speed she can run, then she can run at 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is thrice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/3=2 miles per hour.\nIf two thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*2/3=<<6*2/3=4>>4 hours.\nIf one third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.\nShe walks for 4 hours at 2 miles per hour, or 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 12+8=<<12+8=20>>20 miles.\n#### 20", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
