{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 498 minutes to cover every 7 miles of the city. If the city is 26 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 26/7 = <<26/7=3>>3 intervals of 498 minutes.\nThus, it will take 3 * 498 = <<3*498=1494>>1494 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 1494", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
