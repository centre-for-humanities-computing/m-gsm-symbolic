{"question": "Chris is selling gingerbread and melon pie for a fundraiser. On Monday, he sold 25 boxes of gingerbread and 7 fewer boxes of melon pie, than on Tuesday. On Tuesday, he sold 13 more boxes of gingerbread than on Monday and 21 boxes of melon pie. If the gingerbread cost $11 and the melon pie cost $29, how much did Chris earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 25 + 13 = <<25+13=38>>38 boxes of gingerbread on Tuesday.\nThe total number of boxes of gingerbread that Chris sold is 25 + 38 = <<25+38=63>>63.\nChris earned 63*$11 = $<<63*11=693>>693 for selling gingerbread.\nHe sold 21 - 7 = <<21-7=14>>14 boxes of melon pie on Monday.\nThe total number of boxes of melon pie that Chris sold is 21 + 14 = <<21+14=35>>35.\nHe earned 35*$29 = $<<35*29=1015>>1015 for selling melon pie.\nSo, Chris earned $693 + $1015 = $<<693+1015=1708>>1708 for two days.\n#### 1708", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
