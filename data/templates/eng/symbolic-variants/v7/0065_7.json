{"question": "Maya is trying to decide whether to do her financial planning herself or hire one bookkeeper. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 4 fewer hours of contract work, losing £90/hour in missed income. The bookkeeper charges £134. How much more money will she have if she hires the bookkeeper?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Maya does her financial planning herself: £90/hour * 4 hours = £<<90*4=360>>360\nThen subtract the bookkeeper's charge to find how much money Maya saves: £360 - £134 = £<<360-134=226>>226\n#### 226", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
