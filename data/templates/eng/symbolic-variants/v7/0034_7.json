{"question": "Prof. Smith sold his apartment for $800,000. He paid the legal fees that amount to 4% of the selling price and also paid a agent fee that is 4% of the selling price. If he also paid $360,000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment, how much is Prof. Smith's net proceeds from selling the apartment?", "answer": "Prof. Smith paid $800,000*4/100 = $32,000 for the legal fees.\nHe paid $800,000*4/100 = $32,000 for the agent fee.\nSo, Prof. Smith paid a total of $32,000 + $32,000 + $360,000 = $424,000 for the legal, agent, and loan fees.\nHence, Prof. Smith's net proceeds is $800,000 - $424,000 = $376,000.\n#### 376,000", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
