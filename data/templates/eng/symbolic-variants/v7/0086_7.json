{"question": "Emma qualified for a spot on the swimming team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a jersey for $15, a pair of swimming sweatpants for $13 more than the jersey cost, and a pair of sneakers that were originally $30 but were on sale for one third price. She had a coupon for $1 off the package of $14 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The sweatpants were $13 more than the jersey, so they cost $13 + $15 = $<<13+15=28>>28.\nHer sneakers were one third the original $30 price, so they cost $30*1/3=$10.\nWith her coupon, the socks were $14 - $1 = $<<14-1=13>>13.\nThe jersey, sweatpants, sneakers, and socks together cost $15 + $28 + $10 + $13 = $<<15+28+10+13=66>>66.\n#### 66", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
