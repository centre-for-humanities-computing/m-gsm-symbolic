{"question": "Carl watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched a 4-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 60-minute show. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode and a 15-minute show. On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 2-hour episodes. If he watched 20 hours of TV in all, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Thursday.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 hours of TV left.\nAfter Wednesday, he had 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 12 - 4 - 0.25 = 7.75 hours of TV left.\nAfter Saturday, he had 7.75 - 4 = 3.75 hours of TV left.\nEach 60-minute episode is 1 hour.\nThus, E = 3.75/1 = 3.75 episodes.\n#### 3.75", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
