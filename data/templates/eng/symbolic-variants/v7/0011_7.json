{"question": "Chris wants to make different sized ice cubes with 100 ozs of water. He can make giant cubes that use 8 ozs per cube, medium cubes that use 3 ozs, and small cubes that use 1/5 oz. If he makes 5 giant cubes, 11 medium cubes, and 15 small cubes, how many ozs of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 40 ozs of water because 5 times 8 equals <<5*8=40>>40.\nThe medium cubes used up 33 ozs of water because 11 times 3 equals <<11*3=33>>33.\nThe small cubes used up 3 ozs of water because 15 times 1/5 equals 3.\nThis means that Chris has used up 76 ozs of water because 40 plus 33 plus 3 equals 76.\nChris has 24 ozs of water left because 100 minus 76 equals <<100-76=24>>24.\n#### 24", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
