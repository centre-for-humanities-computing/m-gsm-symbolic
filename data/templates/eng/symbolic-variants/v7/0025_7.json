{"question": "In Mrs. Garcia's class of 117 students, 40% of the class are volleyball players. Out of the remaining class, 38% of the students are choir members or part of robotics club members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "40% of the 117 student class are volleyball players so that's 0.4*117 = <<0.4*117=46>>46 students\nThere are 117 students and 46 are volleyball players so that leaves 117-46 = <<117-46=71>>71 students\n38% of the remaining 71 students are part of robotics club members or choir members so that's 0.38*71 = <<0.38*71=26>>26 students\n46 students are volleyball players and 26 are part of robotics club members/choir members so 46+26 = <<46+26=73>>73 students will be leaving early\n#### 73", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
