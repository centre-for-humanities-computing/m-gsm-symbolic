{"question": "A class of 108 students has various hobbies. 22 like to read, 25 like to play badminton, and the rest like to either hike or play music. How many like to hike if the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing badminton?", "answer": "The number of students that like to play music is twice as many as the number who like badminton, so 2 * 25 = <<2*25=50>>50\nThe number that like to hike is 108 total students - 22 that like to read - 25 that like to play badminton - 50 that like to play music = <<108-22-25-50=11>>11\n#### 11", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
