{"question": "Sarah's dad said that she had €170 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have €4 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the bumper cars twice. A round of mini-golf is €8. The bumper cars cost €11 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The bumper cars will cost €22 per person because 11*2 = <<11*2=22>>22\nEach person costs €34 because 4 + 8 + 22 = <<4+8+22=34>>34\n5 total people can attend because 170 / 34 = <<170/34=5>>5\nShe can invite 4 friends because 5 - 1 =<<5-1=4>>4\n#### 4", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
