{"question": "A virus infects nineteen people. Every day, each infected person infects three others. How many people are infected after four days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original nineteen people infect three people each, so 19*3 = <<19*3=57>>57 more people are infected.\nThere are 19+57 = <<19+57=76>>76 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 76*3 = <<76*3=228>>228 more people are infected.\nThere are 76 + 228 = <<76+228=304>>304 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 304*3 = 912 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 304 + 912 = 4864 infected people after four days.\n#### 4864", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
