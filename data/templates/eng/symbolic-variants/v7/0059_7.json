{"question": "I have 12 liters of grape drink that are one fifth water and I wish to add it to 24 liters of apple drink that is one quarter water. But as I pour it, I spill two liters of the grape drink. How much water is in the remaining 34 liters?", "answer": "There are 24*1/4 = <<24*1/4=6>>6 liters of water from the 24 liters apple drink.\nAfter two liters of grape drink was spilled, there were 12-2 = <<12-2=10>>10 liters of grape drink left.\nOut of the 10 liters, 10*1/5 = <<10*1/5=2>>2 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 6 + 2 = <<6+2=8>>8 liters of water out of the 34 liters.\n#### 8", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
