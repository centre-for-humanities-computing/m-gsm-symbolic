{"question": "Chris is feeding his livestock silage. Each alpaca needs 14 kg, and each horse needs 4 kg less than twice the amount each alpaca needs. If there are 41 alpacas and 45 horses, how many kg of silage does Chris need?", "answer": "First figure out how much silage each horse needs: 14 kg * 2 - 4 = <<14*2-4=24>>24 kg/horse\nNow figure out how much silage total the horses need: 24 kg/horse * 45 horses = <<24*45=1080>>1080 kg\nNow figure out how much silage total the alpacas need: 14 kg/alpaca * 41 alpacas = <<14*41=574>>574 kg\nNow add the two amounts of silage to find the total: 1080 kg + 574 kg = <<1080+574=1654>>1654 kg\n#### 1654", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
