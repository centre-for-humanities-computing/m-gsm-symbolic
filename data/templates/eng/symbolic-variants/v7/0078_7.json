{"question": "There are 9 periods in the day for a normal student but Bob has to take 1 extra classes. Each class is 45 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends 1/2 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 9+1=<<9+1=10>>10 classes a day\nThat means he spends 45*10=<<45*10=450>>450 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 450*4=<<450*4=1800>>1800 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1800*1/2=<<1800*1/2=900>>900 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 1800+900+900=<<1800+900+900=3600>>3600 minutes per week\nSo he spends 3600/60=<<3600/60=60>>60 hours per week\n#### 60", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
