{"question": "Oakwood High School is holding graduation in their Auditorium this year which has space for 6700 people. After accounting for 1300 seats for graduates and 200 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?", "answer": "Add graduate and faculty seats together. 1300 + 200 = <<1300+200=1500>>1500 seats for faculty and graduates\nMinus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6700 - 1500 = <<6700-1500=5200>>5200 remaining seats.\nDivide remaining seats by the number of graduates. 5200/1300 = <<5200/1300=4>>4 tickets\n#### 4", "id_orig": 1031, "id_shuffled": 46}
