{"question": "Ella and Lily are sisters from Chicago who love collecting signatures from authors. During their winter break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Ella and Lily compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Ella has 20 signatures in her book, and Lily has 54. The sisters have 2 more weeks of winter break, and they decide they want to reach 135 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Ella and Lily have already collected 20 + 54 signatures = <<20+54=74>>74 signatures.\nSince their goal is 135, they need to collect 135 - 74 signatures. 135 - 74 = <<135-74=61>>61 signatures\n#### 61", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
