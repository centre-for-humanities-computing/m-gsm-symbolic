{"question": "Amanda saw a 60-foot shark with 9 20-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 20 inches/remora * 9 remoras = <<20*9=180>>180 inches.\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 180 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<180/12=15>>15 foot.\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 15 foot / 60 feet * 100% = 25%\n\n#### 25", "id_orig": 473, "id_shuffled": 0}
