{"question": "Noah's van breaks down. The van weighs 2550 kilograms and he has luggage in it weighing 300 kilograms. He also has his two young teammates who weigh 95 kilograms each in it. If the force to move the van is 5% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the van?", "answer": "His two teammates weigh 95*2=<<95*2=190>>190 kilograms\nSo the total weight of the van and everything is 2550+300+190=<<2550+300+190=3040>>3040 kilograms\nSo he needs to generate 3040*0.05=<<3040*0.05=152>>152 kilograms\n#### 152", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
