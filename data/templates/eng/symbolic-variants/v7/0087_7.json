{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Splash World is 300 meters long, and people slide down at 80 meters/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 200 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 100 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 300 meters / 80 meters/minute = <<300/80=3>>3 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 200 meters / 100 meters/minute = <<200/100=2>>2 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 3 minutes - 2 minutes = <<3-2=1>>1 minutes\n#### 1", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
