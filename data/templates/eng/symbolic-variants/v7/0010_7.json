{"question": "To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay $0.5 for each minute of your call. After 18 minutes, that price drops to $0.25 per minute. How much would a 94-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 18 minutes would be a cost of 18 * 0.5 = $<<18*0.5=9>>9.\nAfter that, there are 94 - 18 = <<94-18=76>>76 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 76 minutes cost 76 * 0.25 = $<<76*0.25=19>>19.\nSo in total, the 94-minute call would cost 9 + 19 = $28.\n#### 28", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
