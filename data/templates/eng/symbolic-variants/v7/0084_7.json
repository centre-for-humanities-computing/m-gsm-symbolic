{"question": "Laura buys 7 shares of a stock for €81 each. The stock price increases 40% the first year Laura holds it, then decreases 15% in the second year. What is the final value of all Laura's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Laura's purchase: 7 shares * €81/share = €<<7*81=567>>567\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: €567 * 0.4 = €<<567*0.4=226.8>>226\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: €567 + €226.8 = €<<567+226.8=793.8>>793\nThen multiply that amount by 15% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: €793.8 * 15% = €<<793.8*15*.01=119.07>>119\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: €793 - €119 = €<<793-119=674>>674\n#### 674", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
