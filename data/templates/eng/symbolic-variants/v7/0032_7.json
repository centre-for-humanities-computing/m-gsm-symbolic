{"question": "Dr. Patel is looking for a condo that will not go beyond her $480,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $430,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 6% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 10% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the condo than Dr. Patel's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $430,000*6/100 = $<<430,000*6/100=25,800>>25,800.\nThe transfer fee is $430,000*10/100 = $<<430,000*10/100=43,000>>43,000.\nThe total price of the condo is $430,000 + $25,800 + $43,000 = $498,800.\nSo, it is $498,800 - $480,000 = $<<498,800-480,000=18,800>>18,800 more than Dr. Patel's budget.\n#### 18,800", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
