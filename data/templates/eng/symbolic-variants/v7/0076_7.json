{"question": "David caught 5 trouts last Friday, the first trout he caught weighs 59 kgs, the second trout he caught weighs 52 kgs, and the remaining trout he caught weighs 35 kgs. If a kg of trout costs $0.25, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?", "answer": "David will earn 59*$0.25 = $<<59*0.25=14.75>>14.75 from the first trout.\nHe will earn 52*$0.25 = $<<52*0.25=13>>13 for the second trout.\nThe rest of the trouts are 5-2 = <<5-2=3>>3. He will earn 35*$0.25 = $<<35*0.25=8.75>>8.75 per each of them. So he will earn 3 * 8.75 = <<3*8.75>>=26.25\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is $14.75 + $13 + $26.25= $<<14.75+13+26.25=53>>54.\n#### 54", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
