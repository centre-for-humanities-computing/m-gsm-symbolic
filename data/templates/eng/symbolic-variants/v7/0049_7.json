{"question": "Kenneth collects garbage from 6 different apartment complexes. The first five have 250 apartments each and the last one is 40% bigger than the other five combined. He collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid $0.5 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first five complexes have 5*250=<<5*250=1250>>1250 apartments\nNumber 6 has 1250*0.4=<<1250*0.4=500>>500 more apartments than those five combined.\nSo in total, it has 1250+500=<<1250+500=1750>>1750 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 1750+1250=<<1750+1250=3000>>3000 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 3000*2=<<3000*2=6000>>6000 apartments every week\nSo he makes 6000*$0.5=$<<6000*0.5=3000>>3000 every week\n#### 3000", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
