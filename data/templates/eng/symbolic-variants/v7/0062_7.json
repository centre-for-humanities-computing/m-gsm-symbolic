{"question": "In a set of magician's cards, there are 36 yellow cards, and 63% more orange cards. Blue cards are as many as the sum of yellow and orange cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 63/100 * 36 = <<63/100*36=22>>22 more orange cards than yellow cards.\nWhich means there are 36 + 22 = <<36+22=58>>58 orange cards.\nBlue cards make up to 36 + 58 = <<36+58=94>>94 cards.\nSo in total, there are 94 + 94 = <<94+94=188>>188 cards of different colors.\n#### 188", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
