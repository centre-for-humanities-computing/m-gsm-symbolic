{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $30 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $2 per pound, get 1 pound 1/6 off.\" She scooped up 3 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $2.0 and 10 magnets that were $1.0 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $2 and gets 1 pound 1/6 off. So 1/6 off of 1 pound is $2*1/6 = $0.3333333333333333. The rest of 1 pound does not have discount and costs 1*$2 = $2, so total is $2+$5/3+$2=$17/3\n10 magnets at $1 each is 10*1=$<<10*1=10>>10\nWhen you add all her purchases, 17/3+$2+$10 = $<<17/3+2+10=17>>17\nShe had $30 and spent $17 so she had $30-$17 = $<<30-17=13>>13 left over\n#### 13", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
