How much was the total cost?", "answer": "The total charge for the eclairs was 10*$16 = $<<10*16=160>>160.\nThe total charge for the tarts was 10*$79 = $<<10*79=790>>790.\nThe total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 4*$117 = $<<4*117=468>>468.\nTherefore the total amount Ashley paid for the desserts was $160 + $790 + $468 = $<<160+790+468=1418>>1418.\n#### 1418", "id_orig": 11, "id_shuffled": 36}
