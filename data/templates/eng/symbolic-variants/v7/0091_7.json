{"question": "At David's house, there are twice as many figs as cannolis. He has a total of 70 cannolis in his house. David bought 59 more cannolis at the store and 39 fewer figs than the number of cannolis. Find the combined total of the number of figs and cannolis David has in the house?", "answer": "Before buying any fig and cannoli, David had twice as many figs as cannolis, which is 70 cannolis*2 fig/cannoli = <<70*2=140>>140 figs\nThe total number of figs and cannolis that David had before is 140 figs + 70 cannolis = <<140+70=210>>210 items\nWhen he bought 39 fewer figs than cannolis, he bought 59 figs - 39 figs = <<59-39=20>>20 figs\nIn total, he bought 20 figs + 59 cannolis = <<20+59=79>>79 items\nAfter the purchases, David has 210 items + 79 items = <<210+79=289>>289 total figs and cannolis combined.\n#### 289", "id_orig": 406, "id_shuffled": 91}
