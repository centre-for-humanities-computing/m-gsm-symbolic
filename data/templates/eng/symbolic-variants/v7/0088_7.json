{"question": "Jessica can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 6 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in eight hours if she spends three quarters of the time running and one quarter of the time walking?", "answer": "If Jessica can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 6*2=<<6*2=12>>12 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 12/2=6 miles per hour.\nIf one quarter of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 8*1/4=<<8*1/4=2>>2 hours.\nIf three quarters of the time is spent running, then she runs for 8-2=<<8-2=6>>6 hours.\nThus, she runs for 6 hours at 12 miles per hour, or 6*12=<<6*12=72>>72 miles.\nShe walks for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 72+12=<<72+12=84>>84 miles.\n#### 84", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
