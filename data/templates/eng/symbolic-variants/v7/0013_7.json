{"question": "Jessica is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 26 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 10 potted plants on each of the 59 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 3 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Jessica remain with?", "answer": "Two days ago, before receiving the plants, Jessica had 10*59 = <<10*59=590>>590 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 26 plants, she therefore had a total of 590 + 26 = <<590+26=616>>616 potted plants\nTomorrow, Jessicas plant giveaway will be 59*3 = <<59*3=177>>177 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 616 - 177 = <<616-177=439>>439 potted plants.\n#### 439", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
