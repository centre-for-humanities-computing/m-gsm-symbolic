{"question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 400 calories per serving. If a 175 oz bag has 5 servings, how many ozs can you eat if your daily calorie target is 1950 and you have already consumed 1250 calories?", "answer": "If the total calorie target is 1950 and I have consumed 1250 calories then I have 1950-1250 = <<1950-1250=700>>700 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of cookies has 400 calories and I only have 700 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 700/400 of a serving = 7/4 of a serving\nWe also know that a 175 oz bag of cookies has 5 servings, hence each serving has 175 oz/5 = <<175/5=35>>35 ozs\nIf I can only eat 7/4 of a serving, then I can eat only 35 oz * 7/4 = 61.25 ozs\n#### 61.25", "id_orig": 43, "id_shuffled": 24}
