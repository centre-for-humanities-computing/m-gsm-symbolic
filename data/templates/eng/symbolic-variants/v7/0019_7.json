{"question": "In a 80-item quiz, 25% of the questions are geometry, and the rest are equally divided as algebra and literature questions. If Jessica is sure to get 20% of the geometry questions, and one quarter of the algebra and literature questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?", "answer": "The algebra and literature questions comprises 100% - 25% = 75% of the quiz.\nThere are 80 questions*25/100 = <<80*25/100=20>>20 geometry questions.\nThere are a total of 80 questions*75/100 = <<80*75/100=60>>60 algebra and literature questions.\nIf Jessica is sure to get 20% of the geometry questions, then this means she is sure of her 20 questions*20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 points.\nFrom the algebra and literature questions, she is sure to get one quarter of it correctly so that is 60 questions*1/4 = <<60*1/4=15>>15 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 4 points + 15 points = <<4+15=19>>19 points in her quiz.\n#### 19", "id_orig": 1021, "id_shuffled": 19}
