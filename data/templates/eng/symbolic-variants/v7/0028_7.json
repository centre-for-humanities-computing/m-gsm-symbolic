{"question": "A clinic has a capacity of 1600 beds with 1/10 occupied. Due to the major accident, 35 patients are admitted into the clinic each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the clinic after 2 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/10 of the total capacity of the clinic beds is occupied, it means 1/10 * 1600 = <<1600*1/10=160>>160 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the clinic without new admissions is 1600 beds - 160 beds = <<1600-160=1440>>1440 beds.\nIf 35 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the clinic after one week is 35 patients/day * 7 days/week = 245 patients.\nAfter 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the clinic is 245 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<245*2=490>>490 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 1440 unoccupied beds in the clinic before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1440 beds - 490 beds = <<1440-490=950>>950 unoccupied beds.\n#### 950", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
