{"question": "Abby can peel 5 clams a minute and saute 35 clams in 9 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 70 clams?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Abby to peel the clams: 70 clams / 5 clams/minute = <<70/5=14>>14 minutes\nThen find how many batches of clams she needs to cook: 70 clams / 35 clams/batch = <<70/35=2>>2 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 2 batches * 9 minutes/batch = <<2*9=18>>18 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Abby spends: 18 minutes + 14 minutes = <<18+14=32>>32 minutes\n#### 32", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
