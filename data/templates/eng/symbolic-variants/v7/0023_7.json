{"question": "Anna is knitting winter wear for her 4 grandchildren. They're quadruplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a beanie, cardigan, sweater, leg warmers, and booties for each of them. It takes 3 skeins of wool to make a beanie, 10 for a cardigan, 7 for a sweater, 16 for a pair of leg warmers, and 12 for a pair of booties. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 3 skeins per beanie + 10 skeins per cardigan + 7 skeins per sweater + 16 skeins per pair of leg warmers + 12 skeins per pair of booties = <<3+10+7+16+12=48>>48 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 4*48 = <<4*48=192>>192 skeins of wool.\n#### 192", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
