{"question": "Kenneth goes to the store to buy some tea. The normal brand of tea he buys costs $10 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 10% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses 1 kilogram of tea per day. He also decided to buy himself a cookie for $5. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The tea he bought was 10*0.1=$<<10*0.1=1>>1 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 10+1=$<<10+1=11>>11 per kilogram\nHe goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kilograms of tea a week\nSo he paid 11*7=$<<11*7=77>>77 on tea\nThat means his total bill was 77+5=$<<77+5=82>>82\n#### 82", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
