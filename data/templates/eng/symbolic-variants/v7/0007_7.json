{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his pigs. He buys a variety of oats, apples, cucumbers and hay. Since hay are a rare treat, he only buys six 3-lb boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 12-lb bags. Oats are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys forty 75-lb packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys eighteen 45-lb sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1950 lbs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 lbs of hay.\nHe is buying 6*12 = <<6*12=72>>72 lbs of cucumbers.\nHe is buying 18*45 = <<18*45=810>>810 lbs of apples.\nHe is buying 40*75 = <<40*75=3000>>3000 lbs of oats.\nThe weight of all the feed is 18 + 72 + 810 + 3000 = <<18+72+810+3000=3900>>3900 lbs.\nThus, the farmer needs 3900 / 1950 = <<3900/1950=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
