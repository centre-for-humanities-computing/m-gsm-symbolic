{"question": "If Abby and Jason have 440 yards of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Jason getting 140 yards more than Abby, how much is left over for Abby?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Abby gets and y be the amount Jason gets. We know that y = x + 140, and y + x = 440.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+140=440\nSubtracting the 140 from both sides, we get 2x=300\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=150. This means Abby has 150 yards of fence left over.\n#### 150", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
