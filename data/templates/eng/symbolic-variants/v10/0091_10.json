{"question": "At William's house, there are twice as many persimmons as apples. He has a total of 68 apples in his house. William bought 72 more apples at the store and 11 fewer persimmons than the number of apples. Find the combined total of the number of persimmons and apples William has in the house?", "answer": "Before buying any persimmon and apple, William had twice as many persimmons as apples, which is 68 apples*2 persimmon/apple = <<68*2=136>>136 persimmons\nThe total number of persimmons and apples that William had before is 136 persimmons + 68 apples = <<136+68=204>>204 items\nWhen he bought 11 fewer persimmons than apples, he bought 72 persimmons - 11 persimmons = <<72-11=61>>61 persimmons\nIn total, he bought 61 persimmons + 72 apples = <<61+72=133>>133 items\nAfter the purchases, William has 204 items + 133 items = <<204+133=337>>337 total persimmons and apples combined.\n#### 337", "id_orig": 406, "id_shuffled": 91}
