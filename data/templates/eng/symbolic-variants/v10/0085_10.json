{"question": "If Eric and Laura have 360 feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Laura getting 20 feet more than Eric, how much is left over for Eric?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Eric gets and y be the amount Laura gets. We know that y = x + 20, and y + x = 360.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+20=360\nSubtracting the 20 from both sides, we get 2x=340\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=170. This means Eric has 170 feet of fence left over.\n#### 170", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
