{"question": "A clinic has a capacity of 900 rooms with 1/3 occupied. Due to the major accident, 20 patients are admitted into the clinic each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the clinic after 4 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/3 of the total capacity of the clinic rooms is occupied, it means 1/3 * 900 = <<900*1/3=300>>300 rooms have patients using them.\nThe total number of rooms in the clinic without new admissions is 900 rooms - 300 rooms = <<900-300=600>>600 rooms.\nIf 20 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the clinic after one week is 20 patients/day * 7 days/week = 140 patients.\nAfter 4 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the clinic is 140 patients/week * 4 weeks = <<140*4=560>>560 patients, who each use one room.\nIf there were 600 unoccupied rooms in the clinic before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 600 rooms - 560 rooms = <<600-560=40>>40 unoccupied rooms.\n#### 40", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
