{"question": "One goblin can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a silver pickaxe and 70% more with a mithril pickaxe than with a silver pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 20 goblins with mithril pickaxes mine in a month with 29 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a goblin can mine with an silver pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day\nThen multiply that amount by 170% to find how much a goblin can mine with a mithril pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 170% = <<10*170*.01=17>>17 pounds/day\nThen multiply the amount one goblin can mine in a day with a mithril pickaxe by the number of goblins: 17 pounds/day/goblin * 20 goblins = <<17*20=340>>340 pounds/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 340 pounds/day * 29 days = <<340*29=9860>>9860 pounds/day\n#### 9860", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
