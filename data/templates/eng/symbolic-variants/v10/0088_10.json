{"question": "Ava can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is one quarter as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends two thirds of the time running and one third of the time walking?", "answer": "If Ava can skip at one quarter the speed she can run, then she can run at 2*4=<<2*4=8>>8 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 8/2=4 miles per hour.\nIf one third of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*1/3=<<6*1/3=2>>2 hours.\nIf two thirds of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 hours.\nThus, she runs for 4 hours at 8 miles per hour, or 4*8=<<4*8=32>>32 miles.\nShe walks for 2 hours at 4 miles per hour, or 2*4=<<2*4=8>>8 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 32+8=<<32+8=40>>40 miles.\n#### 40", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
