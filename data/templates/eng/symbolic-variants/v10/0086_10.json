{"question": "Sarah qualified for a spot on the swimming team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a jersey for €12, a pair of swimming sweatpants for €11 more than the jersey cost, and a pair of sneakers that were originally €56 but were on sale for one quarter price. She had a coupon for €4 off the package of €13 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The sweatpants were €11 more than the jersey, so they cost €11 + €12 = €<<11+12=23>>23.\nHer sneakers were one quarter the original €56 price, so they cost €56*1/4=€14.\nWith her coupon, the socks were €13 - €4 = €<<13-4=9>>9.\nThe jersey, sweatpants, sneakers, and socks together cost €12 + €23 + €14 + €9 = €<<12+23+14+9=58>>58.\n#### 58", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
