{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 7 minutes to cover every 88 miles of the city. If the city is 76 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 76/88 = <<76/88=0>>0 intervals of 7 minutes.\nThus, it will take 0 * 7 = <<0*7=0>>0 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 0", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
