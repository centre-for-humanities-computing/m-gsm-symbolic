{"question": "I have 17 liters of apple drink that are three fifths water and I wish to add it to 20 liters of mango drink that is one fifth water. But as I pour it, I spill two liters of the apple drink. How much water is in the remaining 35 liters?", "answer": "There are 20*1/5 = <<20*1/5=4>>4 liters of water from the 20 liters mango drink.\nAfter two liters of apple drink was spilled, there were 17-2 = <<17-2=15>>15 liters of apple drink left.\nOut of the 15 liters, 15*3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 4 + 9 = <<4+9=13>>13 liters of water out of the 35 liters.\n#### 13", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
