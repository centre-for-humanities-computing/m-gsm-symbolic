{"question": "Oliver went to buy some school supplies. He bought 24 crayons which cost $2.0 each, 10 erasers which cost $16.5 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost $24. How much did Oliver spend on everything?", "answer": "Oliver spent 24*$2 = $<<24*2=48>>48 for the crayons.\nHe also spent 10*$16.5 = $<<10*16.5=165>>165 for the erasers.\nTherefore, Oliver spent a total of $48 + $165 + $24 = $<<48+165+24=237>>237 for the school supplies.\n#### 237", "id_orig": 158, "id_shuffled": 18}
