{"question": "Ava can peel 10 onions a minute and saute 35 onions in 12 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 70 onions?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Ava to peel the onions: 70 onions / 10 onions/minute = <<70/10=7>>7 minutes\nThen find how many batches of onions she needs to cook: 70 onions / 35 onions/batch = <<70/35=2>>2 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 2 batches * 12 minutes/batch = <<2*12=24>>24 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Ava spends: 24 minutes + 7 minutes = <<24+7=31>>31 minutes\n#### 31", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
