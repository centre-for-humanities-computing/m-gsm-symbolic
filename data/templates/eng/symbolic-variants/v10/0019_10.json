{"question": "In a 60-item quiz, 50% of the questions are physics, and the rest are equally divided as history and geometry questions. If Emily is sure to get 50% of the physics questions, and one third of the history and geometry questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?", "answer": "The history and geometry questions comprises 100% - 50% = 50% of the quiz.\nThere are 60 questions*50/100 = <<60*50/100=30>>30 physics questions.\nThere are a total of 60 questions*50/100 = <<60*50/100=30>>30 history and geometry questions.\nIf Emily is sure to get 50% of the physics questions, then this means she is sure of her 30 questions*50/100 = <<30*50/100=15>>15 points.\nFrom the history and geometry questions, she is sure to get one third of it correctly so that is 30 questions*1/3 = <<30*1/3=10>>10 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 15 points + 10 points = <<15+10=25>>25 points in her quiz.\n#### 25", "id_orig": 1021, "id_shuffled": 19}
