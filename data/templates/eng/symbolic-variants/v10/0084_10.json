{"question": "Abby buys 17 shares of a stock for £25 each. The stock price increases 35% the first year Abby holds it, then decreases 30% in the second year. What is the final value of all Abby's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Abby's purchase: 17 shares * £25/share = £<<17*25=425>>425\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: £425 * 0.35 = £<<425*0.35=148.75>>148\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: £425 + £148.75 = £<<425+148.75=573.75>>573\nThen multiply that amount by 30% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: £573.75 * 30% = £<<573.75*30*.01=172.125>>172\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: £573 - £172 = £<<573-172=401>>401\n#### 401", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
