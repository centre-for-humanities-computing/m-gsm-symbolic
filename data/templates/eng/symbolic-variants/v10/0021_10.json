{"question": "Carl watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Saturday and Sunday, he watched a 5-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show. On Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 15-minute show. On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 5-hour episodes. If he watched 27 hours of TV in all, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Monday.\nAfter Saturday, he had 27 - 5 = <<27-5=22>>22 hours of TV left.\nAfter Sunday, he had 22 - 5 = <<22-5=17>>17 hours of TV left.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 17 - 1 - 0.25 = 15.75 hours of TV left.\nAfter Wednesday, he had 15.75 - 10 = 5.75 hours of TV left.\nEach 45-minute episode is 3/4 hour.\nThus, E = 5.75/0.75 = 7.666666666666667 episodes.\n#### 7.666666666666667", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
