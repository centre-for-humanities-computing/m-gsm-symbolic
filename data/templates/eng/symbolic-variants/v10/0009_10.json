The tower of stacking rings has 15 multicolored rings on it. Amanda recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her brother up to 227. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Amanda has 72 + 47 + 15 + T = 134 + T = 227 toys for her brother.\nThus, T = 227 - 134 = <<227-134=93>>93 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 93", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
