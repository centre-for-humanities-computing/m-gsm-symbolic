{"question": "Andrea's dad said that she had €140 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of bowling, have €6 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice. A round of bowling is €3. The go-karts cost €13 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The go-karts will cost €26 per person because 13*2 = <<13*2=26>>26\nEach person costs €35 because 6 + 3 + 26 = <<6+3+26=35>>35\n4 total people can attend because 140 / 35 = <<140/35=4>>4\nShe can invite 3 friends because 4 - 1 =<<4-1=3>>3\n#### 3", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
