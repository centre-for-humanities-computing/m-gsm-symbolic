{"question": "Sarah is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the farsi alphabet (with 32 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full five times, writes one quarter of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Sarah written in total?", "answer": "Sarah has written the farsi alphabet (with 32 letters) five times which is a total of 32*5=<<32*5=160>>160 letters.\nShe then writes one quarter the farsi alphabet (with 32 letters), which is 32*1/4=<<32*1/4=8>>8 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 160 + 8 = <<160+8=168>>168 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 168 * 2 = <<168*2=336>>336 letters.\n#### 336", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
