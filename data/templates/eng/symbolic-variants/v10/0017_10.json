{"question": "Olivia walks 21 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 7 miles of walking on the beach and 14 mile(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 42 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 21-mile walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Olivia walks at a rate of 7 miles per 42 minutes, or 7/42 = 1/6 miles per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at four times the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 4*1/6 = 0.6666666666666666 miles per minute.\nTo walk 14 mile(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 14/0.6666666666666666 = <<14/0.6666666666666666=21>>21 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Olivia 42+21 = <<42+21=63>>63 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 63", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
