{"question": "Laura and Sophie are sisters from Houston who love collecting signatures from politicians. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 7 weeks, Laura and Sophie compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Laura has 15 signatures in her book, and Sophie has 51. The sisters have 4 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 105 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Laura and Sophie have already collected 15 + 51 signatures = <<15+51=66>>66 signatures.\nSince their goal is 105, they need to collect 105 - 66 signatures. 105 - 66 = <<105-66=39>>39 signatures\n#### 39", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
