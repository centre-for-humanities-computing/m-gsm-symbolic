{"question": "Michael's car breaks down. The car weighs 1250 kilograms and he has equipment in it weighing 250 kilograms. He also has his two young friends who weigh 90 kilograms each in it. If the force to move the car is 5% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the car?", "answer": "His two friends weigh 90*2=<<90*2=180>>180 kilograms\nSo the total weight of the car and everything is 1250+250+180=<<1250+250+180=1680>>1680 kilograms\nSo he needs to generate 1680*0.05=<<1680*0.05=84>>84 kilograms\n#### 84", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
