{"question": "Jason caught 7 tunes last Tuesday, the first tune he caught weighs 43 pounds, the second tune he caught weighs 34 pounds, and the remaining tune he caught weighs 33 pounds. If a pound of tune costs £0.75, how much will he earn after selling all the tunes to the market?", "answer": "Jason will earn 43*£0.75 = £<<43*0.75=32.25>>32.25 from the first tune.\nHe will earn 34*£0.75 = £<<34*0.75=25.5>>25.5 for the second tune.\nThe rest of the tunes are 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5. He will earn 33*£0.75 = £<<33*0.75=24.75>>24.75 per each of them. So he will earn 5 * 24.75 = <<5*24.75>>=123.75\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunes is £32.25 + £25.5 + £123.75= £<<32.25+25.5+123.75=180>>181.\n#### 181", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
