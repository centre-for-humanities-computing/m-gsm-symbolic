{"question": "To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay €0.5 for each minute of your call. After 31 minutes, that price drops to €0.2 per minute. How much would a 90-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 31 minutes would be a cost of 31 * 0.5 = €<<31*0.5=15>>15.\nAfter that, there are 90 - 31 = <<90-31=59>>59 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 59 minutes cost 59 * 0.2 = €<<59*0.2=11>>11.\nSo in total, the 90-minute call would cost 15 + 11 = €26.\n#### 27", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
