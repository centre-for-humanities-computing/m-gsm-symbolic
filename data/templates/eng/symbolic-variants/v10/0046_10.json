{"question": "Greenville High School is holding graduation in their Sports Arena this year which has space for 5200 people. After accounting for 1300 seats for graduates and 100 seats for faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?", "answer": "Add graduate and faculty seats together. 1300 + 100 = <<1300+100=1400>>1400 seats for faculty and graduates\nMinus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 5200 - 1400 = <<5200-1400=3800>>3800 remaining seats.\nDivide remaining seats by the number of graduates. 3800/1300 = <<3800/1300=2>>2 tickets\n#### 2", "id_orig": 1031, "id_shuffled": 46}
