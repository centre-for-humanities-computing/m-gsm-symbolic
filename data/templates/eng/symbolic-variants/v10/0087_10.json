{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Neptunes Kingdom is 300 yards long, and people slide down at 60 yards/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 260 yards long, but steeper, so people slide down at 65 yards/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 300 yards / 60 yards/minute = <<300/60=5>>5 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 260 yards / 65 yards/minute = <<260/65=4>>4 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 5 minutes - 4 minutes = <<5-4=1>>1 minutes\n#### 1", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
