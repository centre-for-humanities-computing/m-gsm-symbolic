Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 34 forks. How many forks were in the package that Emma bought?", "answer": "The total number of forks from Emma and her husband was 34+8=<<34+8=42>>42 forks.\nSince the husband bought a package of 11 forks, then Emma's package contained 42-11=<<42-11=31>>31 forks.\n#### 31", "id_orig": 125, "id_shuffled": 22}
