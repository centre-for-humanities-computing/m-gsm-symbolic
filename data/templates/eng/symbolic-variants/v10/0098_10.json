{"question": "A parasite infects six people. Every day, each infected person infects two others. How many people are infected after four days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original six people infect two people each, so 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 more people are infected.\nThere are 6+12 = <<6+12=18>>18 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 18*2 = <<18*2=36>>36 more people are infected.\nThere are 18 + 36 = <<18+36=54>>54 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 54*2 = 108 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 54 + 108 = 486 infected people after four days.\n#### 486", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
