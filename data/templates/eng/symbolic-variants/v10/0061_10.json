{"question": "Bob has a bag of buttons with 38 inside. He tripped over a rock while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 12. When he went back home, he inspected the buttons further. Four of the ones he picked up weren't buttons, but actually coins so he got rid of them. How many buttons did Bob end up with?", "answer": "Bob dropped his buttons and was left with 38*1/2=<<38*1/2=19>>19 buttons.\nHe searched and found some of his lost buttons, getting him back to 19+12=<<19+12=31>>31 buttons.\nHe went home and removed four coins, leaving him with 31-4=<<31-4=27>>27 buttons.\n#### 27", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
