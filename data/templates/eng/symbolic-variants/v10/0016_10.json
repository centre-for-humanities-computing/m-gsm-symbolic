{"question": "David is selling muffins and banana pie for a fundraiser. On Thursday, he sold 30 boxes of muffins and 14 fewer boxes of banana pie, than on Friday. On Friday, he sold 12 more boxes of muffins than on Thursday and 24 boxes of banana pie. If the muffins cost €9 and the banana pie cost €31, how much did David earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 30 + 12 = <<30+12=42>>42 boxes of muffins on Friday.\nThe total number of boxes of muffins that David sold is 30 + 42 = <<30+42=72>>72.\nDavid earned 72*€9 = €<<72*9=648>>648 for selling muffins.\nHe sold 24 - 14 = <<24-14=10>>10 boxes of banana pie on Thursday.\nThe total number of boxes of banana pie that David sold is 24 + 10 = <<24+10=34>>34.\nHe earned 34*€31 = €<<34*31=1054>>1054 for selling banana pie.\nSo, David earned €648 + €1054 = €<<648+1054=1702>>1702 for two days.\n#### 1702", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
