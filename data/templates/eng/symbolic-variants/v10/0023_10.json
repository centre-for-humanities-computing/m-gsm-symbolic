{"question": "Olivia is knitting winter wear for her 5 grandchildren. They're quintuplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a tunic, sweater, hat, booties, and socks for each of them. It takes 15 skeins of wool to make a tunic, 9 for a sweater, 3 for a hat, 8 for a pair of booties, and 11 for a pair of socks. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 15 skeins per tunic + 9 skeins per sweater + 3 skeins per hat + 8 skeins per pair of booties + 11 skeins per pair of socks = <<15+9+3+8+11=46>>46 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 5*46 = <<5*46=230>>230 skeins of wool.\n#### 230", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
