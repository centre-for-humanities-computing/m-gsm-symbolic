{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his sheep. He buys a variety of wheats, apples, cucumbers and corns. Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 8-pound bags. Wheats are the main diet of his sheep, so he buys thirty-six 60-pound packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the wheats, so he buys eighteen 60-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1650 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 4*3 = <<4*3=12>>12 pounds of corns.\nHe is buying 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 pounds of cucumbers.\nHe is buying 18*60 = <<18*60=1080>>1080 pounds of apples.\nHe is buying 36*60 = <<36*60=2160>>2160 pounds of wheats.\nThe weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 1080 + 2160 = <<12+48+1080+2160=3300>>3300 pounds.\nThus, the farmer needs 3300 / 1650 = <<3300/1650=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
