{"question": "There are 7 periods in the day for a normal student but Lucas has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 35 minutes long. He goes to class for 4 days a week. He then spends 1/4 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 7+3=<<7+3=10>>10 classes a day\nThat means he spends 35*10=<<35*10=350>>350 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 350*4=<<350*4=1400>>1400 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 1400*1/4=<<1400*1/4=350>>350 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 1400+350+350=<<1400+350+350=2100>>2100 minutes per week\nSo he spends 2100/60=<<2100/60=35>>35 hours per week\n#### 35", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
