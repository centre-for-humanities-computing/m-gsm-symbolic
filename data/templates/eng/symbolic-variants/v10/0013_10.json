{"question": "Anna is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 40 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 11 potted plants on each of the 42 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 3 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Anna remain with?", "answer": "Two days ago, before receiving the plants, Anna had 11*42 = <<11*42=462>>462 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 40 plants, she therefore had a total of 462 + 40 = <<462+40=502>>502 potted plants\nTomorrow, Annas plant giveaway will be 42*3 = <<42*3=126>>126 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 502 - 126 = <<502-126=376>>376 potted plants.\n#### 376", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
