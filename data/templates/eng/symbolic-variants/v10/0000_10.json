{"question": "Henry saw a 400-foot shark with 2 24-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 24 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<24*2=48>>48 inches.\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 48 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<48/12=4>>4 foot.\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 4 foot / 400 feet * 100% = 1%\n\n#### 1", "id_orig": 473, "id_shuffled": 0}
