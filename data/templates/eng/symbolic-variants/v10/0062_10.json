{"question": "In a set of scientist's cards, there are 32 purple cards, and 65% more red cards. Yellow cards are as many as the sum of purple and red cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 65/100 * 32 = <<65/100*32=20>>20 more red cards than purple cards.\nWhich means there are 32 + 20 = <<32+20=52>>52 red cards.\nYellow cards make up to 32 + 52 = <<32+52=84>>84 cards.\nSo in total, there are 84 + 84 = <<84+84=168>>168 cards of different colors.\n#### 168", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
