{"question": "Mrs. Lee is looking for a apartment that will not go beyond her $320,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $280,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 4% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 11% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the apartment than Mrs. Lee's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $280,000*4/100 = $<<280,000*4/100=11,200>>11,200.\nThe transfer fee is $280,000*11/100 = $<<280,000*11/100=30,800>>30,800.\nThe total price of the apartment is $280,000 + $11,200 + $30,800 = $322,000.\nSo, it is $322,000 - $320,000 = $<<322,000-320,000=2000>>2000 more than Mrs. Lee's budget.\n#### 2000", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
