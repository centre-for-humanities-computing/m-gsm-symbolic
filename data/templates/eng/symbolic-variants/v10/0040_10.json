{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $36 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $4 per pound, get 1 pound 1/2 off.\" She scooped up 6 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $4.0 and 10 magnets that were $0.0 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $4 and gets 1 pound 1/2 off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $4*1/2 = $2. The rest of 4 pound does not have discount and costs 4*$4 = $16, so total is $4+$2+$16=$22\n10 magnets at $0 each is 10*0=$<<10*0=0>>0\nWhen you add all her purchases, 22+$4+$0 = $<<22+4+0=26>>26\nShe had $36 and spent $26 so she had $36-$26 = $<<36-26=10>>10 left over\n#### 10", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
