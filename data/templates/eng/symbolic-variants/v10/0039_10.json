{"question": "A cleaner has to clean a office building with 220 floors. They have 11 days to get it done. It takes them 15 minutes per floor. If they work 10 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?", "answer": "They have to clean 20 floors a day because 220 / 11 = <<220/11=20>>20\nThey spend 300 minutes cleaning per day because 20*15 = <<20*15=300>>300\nThey spend 5 hours a day because 300 / 60 = <<300/60=5>>5\nThey spend 1/2 of their day cleaning floors because 5 / 10 = <<5/10=0.5>>0.5\nThey spend 50% of their day cleaning floors because 0.5*100 = <<0.5*100=50>>50\n#### 50", "id_orig": 1239, "id_shuffled": 39}
