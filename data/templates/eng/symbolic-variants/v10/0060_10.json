How much money did Kenneth make in April if the company performed very well for the whole month?", "answer": "In a day, Kenneth makes 9 * 24 = £<<9*24=216>>216\nIf he works seven days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 7*4=<<7*4=28>>28 days.\nSince he makes £216 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 28 * 216= £<<28*216=6048>>6048.\nHe also got a 538 * 4 = £<<538*4=2152>>2152 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.\nAt the end of April, he earned 6048 + 2152 = £<<6048+2152=8200>>8200.\n#### 8200", "id_orig": 304, "id_shuffled": 60}
