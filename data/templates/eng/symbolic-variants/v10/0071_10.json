{"question": "Oliver is feeding his livestock silage. Each pig needs 8 kg, and each horse needs 7 kg less than twice the amount each pig needs. If there are 34 pigs and 24 horses, how many kg of silage does Oliver need?", "answer": "First figure out how much silage each horse needs: 8 kg * 2 - 7 = <<8*2-7=9>>9 kg/horse\nNow figure out how much silage total the horses need: 9 kg/horse * 24 horses = <<9*24=216>>216 kg\nNow figure out how much silage total the pigs need: 8 kg/pig * 34 pigs = <<8*34=272>>272 kg\nNow add the two amounts of silage to find the total: 216 kg + 272 kg = <<216+272=488>>488 kg\n#### 488", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
