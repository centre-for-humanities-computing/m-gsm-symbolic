{"question": "Abby is trying to decide whether to do her business accounting herself or hire one accountant. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 8 fewer hours of part-time work, losing £83/hour in missed income. The accountant charges £199. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Abby does her business accounting herself: £83/hour * 8 hours = £<<83*8=664>>664\nThen subtract the accountant's charge to find how much money Abby saves: £664 - £199 = £<<664-199=465>>465\n#### 465", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
