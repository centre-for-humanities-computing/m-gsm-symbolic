{"question": "Carl goes to the store to buy some sugar. The normal brand of sugar he buys costs $7 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 10% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses 1 kg of sugar per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for $5. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The sugar he bought was 7*0.1=$<<7*0.1=0>>0 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 7+0=$<<7+0=7>>7 per kg\nHe goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kgs of sugar a week\nSo he paid 7.7*7=$<<7.7*7=53>>53 on sugar\nThat means his total bill was 53+5=$<<53+5=58>>58\n#### 58", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
