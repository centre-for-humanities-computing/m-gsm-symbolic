{"question": "In Mr. Smith's class of 130 students, 13% of the class are volleyball players. Out of the remaining class, 27% of the students are choir members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "13% of the 130 student class are volleyball players so that's 0.13*130 = <<0.13*130=16>>16 students\nThere are 130 students and 16 are volleyball players so that leaves 130-16 = <<130-16=114>>114 students\n27% of the remaining 114 students are part of dancers or choir members so that's 0.27*114 = <<0.27*114=30>>30 students\n16 students are volleyball players and 30 are part of dancers/choir members so 16+30 = <<16+30=47>>47 students will be leaving early\n#### 47", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
