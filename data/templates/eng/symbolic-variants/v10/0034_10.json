If he also paid $450,000 for the remaining loan amount of the villa, how much is Mr. Rodriguez's net proceeds from selling the villa?", "answer": "Mr. Rodriguez paid $930,000*2/100 = $18,600 for the transfer fees.\nHe paid $930,000*3/100 = $27,900 for the brokerage fee.\nSo, Mr. Rodriguez paid a total of $18,600 + $27,900 + $450,000 = $496,500 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.\nHence, Mr. Rodriguez's net proceeds is $930,000 - $496,500 = $433,500.\n#### 433,500", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
