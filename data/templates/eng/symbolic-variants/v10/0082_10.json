{"question": "At the beginning of the meeting, there were 55 engineers and 17 doctors. After an hour, 1/6 of the total number of people left. How many doctors are left if 16 engineers stayed at the meeting?", "answer": "There were a total of 55 engineers + 17 doctors = <<55+17=72>>72 people who attended the meeting.\nAfter an hour, 72 people * 1/6 = <<72*1/6=12>>12 people left the meeting.\nThis means 72 people - 12 people = <<72-12=60>>60 people stayed.\nOut of the 60 who stayed, 60 people - 16 engineers = <<60-16=44>>44 were doctors.\n#### 44", "id_orig": 320, "id_shuffled": 82}
