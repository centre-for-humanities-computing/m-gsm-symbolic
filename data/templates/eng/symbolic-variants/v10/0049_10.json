{"question": "Joshua collects garbage from 6 different apartment complexes. The first five have 250 apartments each and the last one is 35% bigger than the other five combined. He collects garbage 5 times a week from each place and he gets paid £0.4 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first five complexes have 5*250=<<5*250=1250>>1250 apartments\nNumber 6 has 1250*0.35=<<1250*0.35=437.5>>437 more apartments than those five combined.\nSo in total, it has 1250+437=<<1250+437=1687>>1687 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 1687+1250=<<1687+1250=2937.5>>2937 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 2937*5=<<2937*5=14,687.5>>14,687 apartments every week\nSo he makes 14,687*£0.4=£<<14,687*0.4=5875>>5875 every week\n#### 5875", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
