{"question": "The vending machines sell pretzels for 35 cents and popcorn for 125 cents. William spent €10 and got 1 bags of pretzels and had 9% of his money left in change. How many popcorn did he buy?", "answer": "William got €0.9 in change because €10*9/100 = <<10*9/100=0.9>>0.9\nWilliam spent €9.1 because 10 - 0.9 = <<10-0.9=9.1>>9.1\nWilliam spent €0.35 on pretzels because 1*0.35 = <<1*0.35=0.35>>0.35\nWilliam spent 8.75 on popcorn because 9.1 - 0.35 = <<9.1-0.35=8.75>>8.75\nWilliam bought 7 popcorn because 8.75 / 1.25 = <<7=7>>7\n#### 7", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
