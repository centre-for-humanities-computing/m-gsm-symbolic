{"question": "William wants to make different sized ice cubes with 164 pounds of water. He can make giant cubes that use 7 pounds per cube, medium cubes that use 2 pounds, and small cubes that use 1/6 pound. If he makes 5 giant cubes, 11 medium cubes, and 24 small cubes, how many pounds of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 35 pounds of water because 5 times 7 equals <<5*7=35>>35.\nThe medium cubes used up 22 pounds of water because 11 times 2 equals <<11*2=22>>22.\nThe small cubes used up 4 pounds of water because 24 times 1/6 equals 4.\nThis means that William has used up 61 pounds of water because 35 plus 22 plus 4 equals 61.\nWilliam has 103 pounds of water left because 164 minus 61 equals <<164-61=103>>103.\n#### 103", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
