{"question": "Eric watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 2-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 15-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 3-hour episodes. If he watched 21 hours of TV in all, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.\nAfter Monday, he had 21 - 2 = <<21-2=19>>19 hours of TV left.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 19 - 2 = <<19-2=17>>17 hours of TV left.\nAfter Thursday, he had 17 - 1 - 0.25 = 15.75 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 15.75 - 12 = 3.75 hours of TV left.\nEach 45-minute episode is 3/4 hour.\nThus, E = 3.75/0.75 = 5 episodes.\n#### 5", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
