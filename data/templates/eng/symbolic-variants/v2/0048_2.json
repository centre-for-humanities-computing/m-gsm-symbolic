{"question": "Isabella can peel 4 mushrooms a minute and saute 20 mushrooms in 13 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 120 mushrooms?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Isabella to peel the mushrooms: 120 mushrooms / 4 mushrooms/minute = <<120/4=30>>30 minutes\nThen find how many batches of mushrooms she needs to cook: 120 mushrooms / 20 mushrooms/batch = <<120/20=6>>6 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 6 batches * 13 minutes/batch = <<6*13=78>>78 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Isabella spends: 78 minutes + 30 minutes = <<78+30=108>>108 minutes\n#### 108", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
