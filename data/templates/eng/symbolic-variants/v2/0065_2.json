{"question": "Maya is trying to decide whether to do her financial planning herself or hire one financial advisor. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 7 fewer hours of consulting work, losing £41/hour in missed income. The financial advisor charges £78. How much more money will she have if she hires the financial advisor?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Maya does her financial planning herself: £41/hour * 7 hours = £<<41*7=287>>287\nThen subtract the financial advisor's charge to find how much money Maya saves: £287 - £78 = £<<287-78=209>>209\n#### 209", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
