{"question": "At Joshua's house, there are five times as many kiwis as pears. He has a total of 99 pears in his house. Joshua bought 72 more pears at the store and 42 fewer kiwis than the number of pears. Find the combined total of the number of kiwis and pears Joshua has in the house?", "answer": "Before buying any kiwi and pear, Joshua had five times as many kiwis as pears, which is 99 pears*5 kiwi/pear = <<99*5=495>>495 kiwis\nThe total number of kiwis and pears that Joshua had before is 495 kiwis + 99 pears = <<495+99=594>>594 items\nWhen he bought 42 fewer kiwis than pears, he bought 72 kiwis - 42 kiwis = <<72-42=30>>30 kiwis\nIn total, he bought 30 kiwis + 72 pears = <<30+72=102>>102 items\nAfter the purchases, Joshua has 594 items + 102 items = <<594+102=696>>696 total kiwis and pears combined.\n#### 696", "id_orig": 406, "id_shuffled": 91}
