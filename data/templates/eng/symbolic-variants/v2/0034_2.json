{"question": "Dr. Williams sold his condo for $670,000. He paid the legal fees that amount to 1% of the selling price and also paid a agent fee that is 4% of the selling price. If he also paid $420,000 for the remaining loan amount of the condo, how much is Dr. Williams's net proceeds from selling the condo?", "answer": "Dr. Williams paid $670,000*1/100 = $6700 for the legal fees.\nHe paid $670,000*4/100 = $26,800 for the agent fee.\nSo, Dr. Williams paid a total of $6700 + $26,800 + $420,000 = $453,500 for the legal, agent, and loan fees.\nHence, Dr. Williams's net proceeds is $670,000 - $453,500 = $216,500.\n#### 216,500", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
