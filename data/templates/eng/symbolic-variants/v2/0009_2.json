{"question": "When Sophie watches her nephew, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 67 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 26 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 20 multicolored rings on it. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 174. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?", "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 67 + 26 + 20 + T = 113 + T = 174 toys for her nephew.\nThus, T = 174 - 113 = <<174-113=61>>61 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 61", "id_orig": 930, "id_shuffled": 9}
