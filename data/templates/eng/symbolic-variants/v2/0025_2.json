{"question": "In Dr. Lee's class of 68 students, 17% of the class are basketball players. Out of the remaining class, 23% of the students are dancers or part of debate team members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "17% of the 68 student class are basketball players so that's 0.17*68 = <<0.17*68=11>>11 students\nThere are 68 students and 11 are basketball players so that leaves 68-11 = <<68-11=57>>57 students\n23% of the remaining 57 students are part of debate team members or dancers so that's 0.23*57 = <<0.23*57=13>>13 students\n11 students are basketball players and 13 are part of debate team members/dancers so 11+13 = <<11+13=24>>24 students will be leaving early\n#### 24", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
