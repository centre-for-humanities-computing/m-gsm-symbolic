Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 30 plates. How many plates were in the package that Ella bought?", "answer": "The total number of plates from Ella and her husband was 30+9=<<30+9=39>>39 plates.\nSince the husband bought a package of 10 plates, then Ella's package contained 39-10=<<39-10=29>>29 plates.\n#### 29", "id_orig": 125, "id_shuffled": 22}
