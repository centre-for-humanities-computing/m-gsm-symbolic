{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of corns, wheats, carrots and apples. Since apples are a rare treat, he only buys six 3-oz boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 8-oz bags. Corns are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys forty 65-oz packs. Wheats are a staple to supplement the corns, so he buys nineteen 50-oz sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1800 ozs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18 ozs of apples.\nHe is buying 4*8 = <<4*8=32>>32 ozs of carrots.\nHe is buying 19*50 = <<19*50=950>>950 ozs of wheats.\nHe is buying 40*65 = <<40*65=2600>>2600 ozs of corns.\nThe weight of all the feed is 18 + 32 + 950 + 2600 = <<18+32+950+2600=3600>>3600 ozs.\nThus, the farmer needs 3600 / 1800 = <<3600/1800=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
