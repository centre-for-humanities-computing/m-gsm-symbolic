{"question": "Henry went to buy some school supplies. He bought 18 erasers which cost £2.5 each, 8 crayons which cost £6.75 each, and a rim of bond paper which cost £24. How much did Henry spend on everything?", "answer": "Henry spent 18*£2.5 = £<<18*2.5=45>>45 for the erasers.\nHe also spent 8*£6.75 = £<<8*6.75=54>>54 for the crayons.\nTherefore, Henry spent a total of £45 + £54 + £24 = £<<45+54+24=123>>123 for the school supplies.\n#### 123", "id_orig": 158, "id_shuffled": 18}
