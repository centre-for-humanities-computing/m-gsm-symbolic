On Wednesday, he sold 11 more boxes of brownies than on Tuesday and 22 boxes of pear pie. If the brownies cost $13 and the pear pie cost $28, how much did Carl earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 21 + 11 = <<21+11=32>>32 boxes of brownies on Wednesday.\nThe total number of boxes of brownies that Carl sold is 21 + 32 = <<21+32=53>>53.\nCarl earned 53*$13 = $<<53*13=689>>689 for selling brownies.\nHe sold 22 - 17 = <<22-17=5>>5 boxes of pear pie on Tuesday.\nThe total number of boxes of pear pie that Carl sold is 22 + 5 = <<22+5=27>>27.\nHe earned 27*$28 = $<<27*28=756>>756 for selling pear pie.\nSo, Carl earned $689 + $756 = $<<689+756=1445>>1445 for two days.\n#### 1445", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
