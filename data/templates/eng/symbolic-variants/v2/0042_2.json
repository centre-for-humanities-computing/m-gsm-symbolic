{"question": "David goes to the store to buy some flour. The normal brand of flour he buys costs $20 per kilogram. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 10% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of flour and he uses 3 kilogram of flour per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for $4. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The flour he bought was 20*0.1=$<<20*0.1=2>>2 more expensive per kilogram than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 20+2=$<<20+2=22>>22 per kilogram\nHe goes through 3*7=<<3*7=21>>21 kilograms of flour a week\nSo he paid 22*21=$<<22*21=462>>462 on flour\nThat means his total bill was 462+4=$<<462+4=466>>466\n#### 466", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
