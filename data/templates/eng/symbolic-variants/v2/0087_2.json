{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Splash World is 300 meters long, and people slide down at 40 meters/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 280 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 70 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 300 meters / 40 meters/minute = <<300/40=7>>7 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 280 meters / 70 meters/minute = <<280/70=4>>4 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 7 minutes - 4 minutes = <<7-4=3>>3 minutes\n#### 3", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
