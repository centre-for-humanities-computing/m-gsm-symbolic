{"question": "One goblin can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with wooden pickaxe. He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe and 35% more with a mithril pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe. How many kgs of ore can 22 goblins with mithril pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a goblin can mine with an bronze pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 kgs/day\nThen multiply that amount by 135% to find how much a goblin can mine with a mithril pickaxe: 10 kgs/day * 135% = <<10*135*.01=13>>13 kgs/day\nThen multiply the amount one goblin can mine in a day with a mithril pickaxe by the number of goblins: 13 kgs/day/goblin * 22 goblins = <<13*22=297>>297 kgs/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 297 kgs/day * 30 days = <<297*30=8910>>8910 kgs/day\n#### 8910", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
