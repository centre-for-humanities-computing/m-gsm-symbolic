{"question": "Joe has a bag of coins with 76 inside. He tripped over a root while carrying it and dropped three quarters of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 11. When he went back home, he inspected the coins further. Nine of the ones he picked up weren't coins, but actually coins so he got rid of them. How many coins did Joe end up with?", "answer": "Joe dropped his coins and was left with 76*1/4=<<76*1/4=19>>19 coins.\nHe searched and found some of his lost coins, getting him back to 19+11=<<19+11=30>>30 coins.\nHe went home and removed nine coins, leaving him with 30-9=<<30-9=21>>21 coins.\n#### 21", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
