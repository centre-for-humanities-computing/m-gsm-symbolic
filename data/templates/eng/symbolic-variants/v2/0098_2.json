{"question": "A parasite infects seven people. Every day, each infected person infects three others. How many people are infected after four days?", "answer": "On the first day, the original seven people infect three people each, so 7*3 = <<7*3=21>>21 more people are infected.\nThere are 7+21 = <<7+21=28>>28 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 28*3 = <<28*3=84>>84 more people are infected.\nThere are 28 + 84 = <<28+84=112>>112 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 112*3 = 336 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 112 + 336 = 1792 infected people after four days.\n#### 1792", "id_orig": 858, "id_shuffled": 98}
