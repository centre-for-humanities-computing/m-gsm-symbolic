{"question": "There are 8 periods in the day for a normal student but Oliver has to take 2 extra classes. Each class is 60 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/3 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 8+2=<<8+2=10>>10 classes a day\nThat means he spends 60*10=<<60*10=600>>600 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 600*6=<<600*6=3600>>3600 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 3600*1/3=<<3600*1/3=1200>>1200 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 3600+1200+1200=<<3600+1200+1200=6000>>6000 minutes per week\nSo he spends 6000/60=<<6000/60=100>>100 hours per week\n#### 100", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
