{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $39 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $5 per pound, get 1 pound 1/12 off.\" She scooped up 3 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $3.0 and 8 magnets that were $0.0 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $5 and gets 1 pound 1/12 off. So 1/12 off of 1 pound is $5*1/12 = $0.4166666666666667. The rest of 1 pound does not have discount and costs 1*$5 = $5, so total is $5+$55/12+$5=$175/12\n8 magnets at $0 each is 8*0=$<<8*0=0>>0\nWhen you add all her purchases, 175/12+$3+$0 = $<<175/12+3+0=17>>17\nShe had $39 and spent $17 so she had $39-$17 = $<<39-17=22>>22 left over\n#### 22", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
