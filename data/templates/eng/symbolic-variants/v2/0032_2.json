{"question": "Mrs. Lee is looking for a condo that will not go beyond her $360,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $320,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 4% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 11% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the condo than Mrs. Lee's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $320,000*4/100 = $<<320,000*4/100=12,800>>12,800.\nThe transfer fee is $320,000*11/100 = $<<320,000*11/100=35,200>>35,200.\nThe total price of the condo is $320,000 + $12,800 + $35,200 = $368,000.\nSo, it is $368,000 - $360,000 = $<<368,000-360,000=8000>>8000 more than Mrs. Lee's budget.\n#### 8000", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
