{"question": "Emily saw a 120-foot dolphin with 9 80-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 80 inches/remora * 9 remoras = <<80*9=720>>720 inches.\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<720/12=60>>60 foot.\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the dolphin's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 60 foot / 120 feet * 100% = 50%\n\n#### 50", "id_orig": 473, "id_shuffled": 0}
