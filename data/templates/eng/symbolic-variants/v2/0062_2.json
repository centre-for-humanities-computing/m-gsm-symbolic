{"question": "In a set of artist's cards, there are 45 blue cards, and 37% more orange cards. Red cards are as many as the sum of blue and orange cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?", "answer": "There are 37/100 * 45 = <<37/100*45=16>>16 more orange cards than blue cards.\nWhich means there are 45 + 16 = <<45+16=61>>61 orange cards.\nRed cards make up to 45 + 61 = <<45+61=106>>106 cards.\nSo in total, there are 106 + 106 = <<106+106=212>>212 cards of different colors.\n#### 212", "id_orig": 456, "id_shuffled": 62}
