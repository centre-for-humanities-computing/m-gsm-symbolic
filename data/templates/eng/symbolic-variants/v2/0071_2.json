{"question": "Carl is feeding his livestock grain. Each horse needs 3 kg, and each llama needs 4 kg less than twice the amount each horse needs. If there are 16 horses and 25 llamas, how many kg of grain does Carl need?", "answer": "First figure out how much grain each llama needs: 3 kg * 2 - 4 = <<3*2-4=2>>2 kg/llama\nNow figure out how much grain total the llamas need: 2 kg/llama * 25 llamas = <<2*25=50>>50 kg\nNow figure out how much grain total the horses need: 3 kg/horse * 16 horses = <<3*16=48>>48 kg\nNow add the two amounts of grain to find the total: 50 kg + 48 kg = <<50+48=98>>98 kg\n#### 98", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
