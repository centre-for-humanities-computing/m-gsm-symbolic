{"question": "Anna buys 13 shares of a stock for €37 each. The stock price increases 60% the first year Anna holds it, then decreases 20% in the second year. What is the final value of all Anna's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Anna's purchase: 13 shares * €37/share = €<<13*37=481>>481\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: €481 * 0.6 = €<<481*0.6=288.6>>288\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: €481 + €288.6 = €<<481+288.6=769.6>>769\nThen multiply that amount by 20% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: €769.6 * 20% = €<<769.6*20*.01=153.92>>153\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: €769 - €153 = €<<769-153=615>>615\n#### 615", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
