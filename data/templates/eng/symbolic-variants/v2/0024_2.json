{"question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 375 calories per serving. If a 300 ounces bag has 6 servings, how many ouncess can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2025 and you have already consumed 1650 calories?", "answer": "If the total calorie target is 2025 and I have consumed 1650 calories then I have 2025-1650 = <<2025-1650=375>>375 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of cookies has 375 calories and I only have 375 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 375/375 of a serving = 1 of a serving\nWe also know that a 300 ounces bag of cookies has 6 servings, hence each serving has 300 ounces/6 = <<300/6=50>>50 ouncess\nIf I can only eat 1 of a serving, then I can eat only 50 ounces * 1 = 50 ouncess\n#### 50", "id_orig": 43, "id_shuffled": 24}
