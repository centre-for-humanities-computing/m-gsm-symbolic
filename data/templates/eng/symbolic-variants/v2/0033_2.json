{"question": "Amanda and Emma are sisters from New York who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Amanda and Emma compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Amanda has 17 signatures in her book, and Emma has 36. The sisters have 4 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 130 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Amanda and Emma have already collected 17 + 36 signatures = <<17+36=53>>53 signatures.\nSince their goal is 130, they need to collect 130 - 53 signatures. 130 - 53 = <<130-53=77>>77 signatures\n#### 77", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
