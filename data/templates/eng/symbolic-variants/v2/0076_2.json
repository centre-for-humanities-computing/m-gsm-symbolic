{"question": "Noah caught 3 trouts last Saturday, the first trout he caught weighs 77 kgs, the second trout he caught weighs 52 kgs, and the remaining trout he caught weighs 37 kgs. If a kg of trout costs £1.5, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?", "answer": "Noah will earn 77*£1.5 = £<<77*1.5=115.5>>115.5 from the first trout.\nHe will earn 52*£1.5 = £<<52*1.5=78>>78 for the second trout.\nThe rest of the trouts are 3-2 = <<3-2=1>>1. He will earn 37*£1.5 = £<<37*1.5=55.5>>55.5 per each of them. So he will earn 1 * 55.5 = <<1*55.5>>=55.5\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is £115.5 + £78 + £55.5= £<<115.5+78+55.5=248>>249.\n#### 249", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
