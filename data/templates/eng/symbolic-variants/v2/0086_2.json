{"question": "Ashley qualified for a spot on the volleyball team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a t-shirt for $17, a pair of volleyball leggings for $9 more than the t-shirt cost, and a pair of athletic shoes that were originally $66 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The leggings were $9 more than the t-shirt, so they cost $9 + $17 = $<<9+17=26>>26.\nHer athletic shoes were half the original $66 price, so they cost $66*1/2=$33.\nWith her coupon, the socks were $8 - $2 = $<<8-2=6>>6.\nThe t-shirt, leggings, athletic shoes, and socks together cost $17 + $26 + $33 + $6 = $<<17+26+33+6=82>>82.\n#### 82", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
