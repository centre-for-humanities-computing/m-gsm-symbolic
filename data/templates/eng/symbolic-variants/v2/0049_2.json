{"question": "Alex collects garbage from 4 different apartment complexes. The first three have 250 apartments each and the last one is 70% bigger than the other three combined. He collects garbage 4 times a week from each place and he gets paid £0.4 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first three complexes have 3*250=<<3*250=750>>750 apartments\nNumber 4 has 750*0.7=<<750*0.7=525>>525 more apartments than those three combined.\nSo in total, it has 750+525=<<750+525=1275>>1275 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 1275+750=<<1275+750=2025>>2025 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 2025*4=<<2025*4=8100>>8100 apartments every week\nSo he makes 8100*£0.4=£<<8100*0.4=3240>>3240 every week\n#### 3240", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
