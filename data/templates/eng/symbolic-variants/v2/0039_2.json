{"question": "A janitor has to clean a university with 75 floors. They have 5 days to get it done. It takes them 10 minutes per floor. If they work 9 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?", "answer": "They have to clean 15 floors a day because 75 / 5 = <<75/5=15>>15\nThey spend 150 minutes cleaning per day because 15*10 = <<15*10=150>>150\nThey spend 2.5 hours a day because 150 / 60 = <<150/60=2.5>>2.5\nThey spend 5/18 of their day cleaning floors because 2.5 / 9 = <<2.5/9=0.2777777777777778>>0.2777777777777778\nThey spend 27% of their day cleaning floors because 0.2777777777777778*100 = <<0.2777777777777778*100=27>>27\n#### 27", "id_orig": 1239, "id_shuffled": 39}
