{"question": "Madison is popping popcorn for a snack. As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 70 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking, then two times that amount in the next 10 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds, but in the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Madison takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Madison have to eat?", "answer": "In the second 10 seconds of cooking, 2*70=<<2*70=140>>140 kernels pop.\nIn the third 10 seconds, 4*70=<<4*70=280>>280 kernels pop.\nIn the final 10 seconds, 280 / 2 = <<280/2=140>>140 kernels pop.\nAfter cooking, the residual heat makes 140 / 4 = <<140/4=35>>35 kernels pop.\nThus, Madison has 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 + 35 = <<70+140+280+140+35=665>>665 pieces of popcorn to eat.\n#### 665", "id_orig": 1264, "id_shuffled": 4}
