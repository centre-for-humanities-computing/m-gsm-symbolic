{"question": "Ella is an avid gardener. Two days ago, she received 44 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 9 potted plants on each of the 44 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 3 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Ella remain with?", "answer": "Two days ago, before receiving the plants, Ella had 9*44 = <<9*44=396>>396 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 44 plants, she therefore had a total of 396 + 44 = <<396+44=440>>440 potted plants\nTomorrow, Ellas plant giveaway will be 44*3 = <<44*3=132>>132 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 440 - 132 = <<440-132=308>>308 potted plants.\n#### 308", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
