{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 479 minutes to cover every 18 miles of the city. If the city is 10 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 10/18 = <<10/18=0>>0 intervals of 479 minutes.\nThus, it will take 0 * 479 = <<0*479=0>>0 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 0", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
