{"question": "I have 9 liters of apple drink that are two thirds water and I wish to add it to 22 liters of lemon drink that is half water. But as I pour it, I spill six liters of the apple drink. How much water is in the remaining 25 liters?", "answer": "There are 22*1/2 = <<22*1/2=11>>11 liters of water from the 22 liters lemon drink.\nAfter six liters of apple drink was spilled, there were 9-6 = <<9-6=3>>3 liters of apple drink left.\nOut of the 3 liters, 3*2/3 = <<3*2/3=2>>2 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 11 + 2 = <<11+2=13>>13 liters of water out of the 25 liters.\n#### 13", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
