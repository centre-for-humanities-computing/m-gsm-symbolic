{"question": "If Ethan and Kenneth have 340 meters of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Kenneth getting 20 meters more than Ethan, how much is left over for Ethan?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Ethan gets and y be the amount Kenneth gets. We know that y = x + 20, and y + x = 340.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+20=340\nSubtracting the 20 from both sides, we get 2x=320\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=160. This means Ethan has 160 meters of fence left over.\n#### 160", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
