{"question": "The vending machines sell cookies for 40 cents and popcorn for 50 cents. Ethan spent $10 and got 2 bags of cookies and had 7% of his money left in change. How many popcorn did he buy?", "answer": "Ethan got $0.7 in change because $10*7/100 = <<10*7/100=0.7>>0.7\nEthan spent $9.3 because 10 - 0.7 = <<10-0.7=9.3>>9.3\nEthan spent $0.8 on cookies because 2*0.4 = <<2*0.4=0.8>>0.8\nEthan spent 8.5 on popcorn because 9.3 - 0.8 = <<9.3-0.8=8.5>>8.5\nEthan bought 17 popcorn because 8.5 / 0.5 = <<17=17>>17\n#### 17", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
