{"question": "Emily walks 20 fts every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 8 fts of walking on the beach and 12 ft(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Emily walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-ft walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Emily walks at a rate of 8 fts per 56 minutes, or 8/56 = 1/7 fts per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/7 = 0.2857142857142857 fts per minute.\nTo walk 12 ft(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 12/0.2857142857142857 = <<12/0.2857142857142857=42>>42 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Emily 56+42 = <<56+42=98>>98 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 98", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
