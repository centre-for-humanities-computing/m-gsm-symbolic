{"question": "Sophia's dad said that she had £240 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of laser tag, have £10 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster twice. A round of laser tag is £10. The roller coaster cost £14 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The roller coaster will cost £28 per person because 14*2 = <<14*2=28>>28\nEach person costs £48 because 10 + 10 + 28 = <<10+10+28=48>>48\n5 total people can attend because 240 / 48 = <<240/48=5>>5\nShe can invite 4 friends because 5 - 1 =<<5-1=4>>4\n#### 4", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
