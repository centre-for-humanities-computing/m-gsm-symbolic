{"question": "Sarah is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a vest, shawl, hat, leg warmers, and gloves for each of them. It takes 17 skeins of wool to make a vest, 16 for a shawl, 12 for a hat, 18 for a pair of leg warmers, and 15 for a pair of gloves. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 17 skeins per vest + 16 skeins per shawl + 12 skeins per hat + 18 skeins per pair of leg warmers + 15 skeins per pair of gloves = <<17+16+12+18+15=78>>78 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3*78 = <<3*78=234>>234 skeins of wool.\n#### 234", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
