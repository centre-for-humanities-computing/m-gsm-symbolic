{"question": "To make a call from a phone booth, you must pay $0.25 for each minute of your call. After 39 minutes, that price drops to $0.2 per minute. How much would a 49-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 39 minutes would be a cost of 39 * 0.25 = $<<39*0.25=9>>9.\nAfter that, there are 49 - 39 = <<49-39=10>>10 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 10 minutes cost 10 * 0.2 = $<<10*0.2=2>>2.\nSo in total, the 49-minute call would cost 9 + 2 = $11.\n#### 11", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
