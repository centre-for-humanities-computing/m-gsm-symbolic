{"question": "Lily is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the hiragana (with 48 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full thrice, writes one third of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Lily written in total?", "answer": "Lily has written the hiragana (with 48 letters) thrice which is a total of 48*3=<<48*3=144>>144 letters.\nShe then writes one third the hiragana (with 48 letters), which is 48*1/3=<<48*1/3=16>>16 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 144 + 16 = <<144+16=160>>160 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 160 * 2 = <<160*2=320>>320 letters.\n#### 320", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
