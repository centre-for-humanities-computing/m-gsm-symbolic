How much money did Kenneth make in June if the company performed very well for the whole month?", "answer": "In a day, Kenneth makes 8 * 26 = $<<8*26=208>>208\nIf he works four days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 days.\nSince he makes $208 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 16 * 208= $<<16*208=3328>>3328.\nHe also got a 126 * 4 = $<<126*4=504>>504 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of June.\nAt the end of June, he earned 3328 + 504 = $<<3328+504=3832>>3832.\n#### 3832", "id_orig": 304, "id_shuffled": 60}
