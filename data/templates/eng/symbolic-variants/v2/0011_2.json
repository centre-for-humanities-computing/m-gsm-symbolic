{"question": "Eric wants to make different sized ice cubes with 228 ozs of water. He can make giant cubes that use 7 ozs per cube, medium cubes that use 4 ozs, and small cubes that use 1/4 oz. If he makes 8 giant cubes, 8 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many ozs of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 56 ozs of water because 8 times 7 equals <<8*7=56>>56.\nThe medium cubes used up 32 ozs of water because 8 times 4 equals <<8*4=32>>32.\nThe small cubes used up 2 ozs of water because 8 times 1/4 equals 2.\nThis means that Eric has used up 90 ozs of water because 56 plus 32 plus 2 equals 90.\nEric has 138 ozs of water left because 228 minus 90 equals <<228-90=138>>138.\n#### 138", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
