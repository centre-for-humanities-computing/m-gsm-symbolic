{"question": "In a 150-item quiz, 50% of the questions are economics, and the rest are equally divided as physics and history questions. If Lily is sure to get 50% of the economics questions, and three fifths of the physics and history questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?", "answer": "The physics and history questions comprises 100% - 50% = 50% of the quiz.\nThere are 150 questions*50/100 = <<150*50/100=75>>75 economics questions.\nThere are a total of 150 questions*50/100 = <<150*50/100=75>>75 physics and history questions.\nIf Lily is sure to get 50% of the economics questions, then this means she is sure of her 75 questions*50/100 = <<75*50/100=37>>37 points.\nFrom the physics and history questions, she is sure to get three fifths of it correctly so that is 75 questions*3/5 = <<75*3/5=45>>45 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 37 points + 45 points = <<37+45=82>>82 points in her quiz.\n#### 82", "id_orig": 1021, "id_shuffled": 19}
