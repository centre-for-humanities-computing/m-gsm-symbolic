{"question": "Lily went to the patisserie and bought various types of baked goods. She bought 3 dozen donuts which cost $15 per dozen, 8 dozen mini cupcakes which cost $83 per dozen, and 6 dozen scones for $115 per dozen. How much was the total cost?", "answer": "The total charge for the donuts was 3*$15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.\nThe total charge for the mini cupcakes was 8*$83 = $<<8*83=664>>664.\nThe total charge for the scones was 6*$115 = $<<6*115=690>>690.\nTherefore the total amount Lily paid for the baked goods was $45 + $664 + $690 = $<<45+664+690=1399>>1399.\n#### 1399", "id_orig": 11, "id_shuffled": 36}
