{"question": "Lucas's car breaks down. The car weighs 2300 kilograms and he has groceries in it weighing 250 kilograms. He also has his two young teammates who weigh 75 kilograms each in it. If the force to move the car is 1% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the car?", "answer": "His two teammates weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 kilograms\nSo the total weight of the car and everything is 2300+250+150=<<2300+250+150=2700>>2700 kilograms\nSo he needs to generate 2700*0.01=<<2700*0.01=27>>27 kilograms\n#### 27", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
