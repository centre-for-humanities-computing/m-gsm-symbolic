{"question": "Emily is trying to decide whether to do her financial planning herself or hire one tax consultant. If she does it herself, she'll be able to do 5 fewer hours of contract work, losing £48/hour in missed income. The tax consultant charges £53. How much more money will she have if she hires the tax consultant?", "answer": "First find the total lost revenue if Emily does her financial planning herself: £48/hour * 5 hours = £<<48*5=240>>240\nThen subtract the tax consultant's charge to find how much money Emily saves: £240 - £53 = £<<240-53=187>>187\n#### 187", "id_orig": 164, "id_shuffled": 65}
