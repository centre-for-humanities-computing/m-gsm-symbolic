{"question": "A group of 174 students has various hobbies. 43 like to bake, 27 like to play running, and the rest like to either hike or read. How many like to hike if the number that like to read is twice the number that prefer playing running?", "answer": "The number of students that like to read is twice as many as the number who like running, so 2 * 27 = <<2*27=54>>54\nThe number that like to hike is 174 total students - 43 that like to bake - 27 that like to play running - 54 that like to read = <<174-43-27-54=50>>50\n#### 50", "id_orig": 740, "id_shuffled": 3}
