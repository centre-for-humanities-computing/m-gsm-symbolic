{"question": "Sally went to the beach for vacation. Her parents gave her $27 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir store, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $1 per pound, get 1 pound 1/5 off.\" She scooped up 6 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $2.5 and 10 magnets that were $0.75 each. How much money does Sally have left?", "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $1 and gets 1 pound 1/5 off. So 1/5 off of 1 pound is $1*1/5 = $0.2. The rest of 4 pound does not have discount and costs 4*$1 = $4, so total is $1+$4/5+$4=$29/5\n10 magnets at $0.75 each is 10*0.75=$<<10*0.75=7.5>>7.5\nWhen you add all her purchases, 29/5+$2.5+$7.5 = $<<29/5+2.5+7.5=15>>15\nShe had $27 and spent $15 so she had $27-$15 = $<<27-15=12>>12 left over\n#### 12", "id_orig": 410, "id_shuffled": 40}
