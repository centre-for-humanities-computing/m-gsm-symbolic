{"question": "Emma can peel 5 carrots a minute and saute 30 carrots in 11 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and saute 120 carrots?", "answer": "First find how long it takes Emma to peel the carrots: 120 carrots / 5 carrots/minute = <<120/5=24>>24 minutes\nThen find how many batches of carrots she needs to cook: 120 carrots / 30 carrots/batch = <<120/30=4>>4 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 4 batches * 11 minutes/batch = <<4*11=44>>44 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Emma spends: 44 minutes + 24 minutes = <<44+24=68>>68 minutes\n#### 68", "id_orig": 989, "id_shuffled": 48}
