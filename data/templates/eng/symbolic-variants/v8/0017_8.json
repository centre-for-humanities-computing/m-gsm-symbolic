{"question": "Sophie walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 19 miles of walking on the beach and 5 mile(s) of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Sophie walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 57 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?", "answer": "On the beach, Sophie walks at a rate of 19 miles per 57 minutes, or 19/57 = 1/3 miles per minute.\nOn the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2*1/3 = 0.6666666666666666 miles per minute.\nTo walk 5 mile(s) on the sidewalk, it takes her 5/0.6666666666666666 = <<5/0.6666666666666666=7.5>>7.5 minutes.\nThus, in total, it takes Sophie 57+7.5 = <<57+7.5=64.5>>64.5 minutes to walk her favorite route.\n#### 64.5", "id_orig": 1133, "id_shuffled": 17}
