{"question": "A maintenance worker has to clean a university with 105 floors. They have 7 days to get it done. It takes them 30 minutes per floor. If they work 16 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?", "answer": "They have to clean 15 floors a day because 105 / 7 = <<105/7=15>>15\nThey spend 450 minutes cleaning per day because 15*30 = <<15*30=450>>450\nThey spend 7.5 hours a day because 450 / 60 = <<450/60=7.5>>7.5\nThey spend 15/32 of their day cleaning floors because 7.5 / 16 = <<7.5/16=0.46875>>0.46875\nThey spend 46% of their day cleaning floors because 0.46875*100 = <<0.46875*100=46>>46\n#### 46", "id_orig": 1239, "id_shuffled": 39}
