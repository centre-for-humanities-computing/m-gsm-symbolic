{"question": "One troll can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe and 30% more with a bronze pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 23 trolls with bronze pickaxes mine in a month with 28 days?", "answer": "First find how much ore a troll can mine with an bronze pickaxe: 5 pounds/day*2=<<5*2=10>>10 pounds/day\nThen multiply that amount by 130% to find how much a troll can mine with a bronze pickaxe: 10 pounds/day * 130% = <<10*130*.01=13>>13 pounds/day\nThen multiply the amount one troll can mine in a day with a bronze pickaxe by the number of trolls: 13 pounds/day/troll * 23 trolls = <<13*23=299>>299 pounds/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 299 pounds/day * 28 days = <<299*28=8372>>8372 pounds/day\n#### 8372", "id_orig": 1026, "id_shuffled": 58}
