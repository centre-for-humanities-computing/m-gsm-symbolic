{"question": "Sarah can run twice faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 2 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one third of the time running and two thirds of the time walking?", "answer": "If Sarah can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 miles per hour.\nAnd since she can run at a speed that is twice faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 4/2=2 miles per hour.\nIf two thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*2/3=<<6*2/3=4>>4 hours.\nIf one third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.\nThus, she runs for 2 hours at 4 miles per hour, or 2*4=<<2*4=8>>8 miles.\nShe walks for 4 hours at 2 miles per hour, or 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 miles.\nThus, altogether, she travels 8+8=<<8+8=16>>16 miles.\n#### 16", "id_orig": 39, "id_shuffled": 88}
