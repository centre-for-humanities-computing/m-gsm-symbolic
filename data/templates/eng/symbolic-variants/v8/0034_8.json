{"question": "Prof. Johnson sold his apartment for $640,000. He paid the registration fees that amount to 3% of the selling price and also paid a realtor fee that is 4% of the selling price. If he also paid $240,000 for the remaining loan amount of the apartment, how much is Prof. Johnson's net proceeds from selling the apartment?", "answer": "Prof. Johnson paid $640,000*3/100 = $19,200 for the registration fees.\nHe paid $640,000*4/100 = $25,600 for the realtor fee.\nSo, Prof. Johnson paid a total of $19,200 + $25,600 + $240,000 = $284,800 for the registration, realtor, and loan fees.\nHence, Prof. Johnson's net proceeds is $640,000 - $284,800 = $355,200.\n#### 355,200", "id_orig": 266, "id_shuffled": 34}
