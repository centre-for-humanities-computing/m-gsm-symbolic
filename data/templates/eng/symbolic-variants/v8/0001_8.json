{"question": "A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 70 minutes to cover every 8 miles of the city. If the city is 96 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?", "answer": "The city will be covered in 96/8 = <<96/8=12>>12 intervals of 70 minutes.\nThus, it will take 12 * 70 = <<12*70=840>>840 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.\n#### 840", "id_orig": 103, "id_shuffled": 1}
