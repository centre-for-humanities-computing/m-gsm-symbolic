{"question": "Oliver is selling gingerbread and kiwi pie for a fundraiser. On Thursday, he sold 21 boxes of gingerbread and 11 fewer boxes of kiwi pie, than on Friday. On Friday, he sold 14 more boxes of gingerbread than on Thursday and 24 boxes of kiwi pie. If the gingerbread cost $10 and the kiwi pie cost $30, how much did Oliver earn for two days?", "answer": "He sold 21 + 14 = <<21+14=35>>35 boxes of gingerbread on Friday.\nThe total number of boxes of gingerbread that Oliver sold is 21 + 35 = <<21+35=56>>56.\nOliver earned 56*$10 = $<<56*10=560>>560 for selling gingerbread.\nHe sold 24 - 11 = <<24-11=13>>13 boxes of kiwi pie on Thursday.\nThe total number of boxes of kiwi pie that Oliver sold is 24 + 13 = <<24+13=37>>37.\nHe earned 37*$30 = $<<37*30=1110>>1110 for selling kiwi pie.\nSo, Oliver earned $560 + $1110 = $<<560+1110=1670>>1670 for two days.\n#### 1670", "id_orig": 976, "id_shuffled": 16}
