{"question": "Oliver goes to the store to buy some tea. The normal brand of tea he buys costs €6 per kg. He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 25% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses 1 kg of tea per day. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for €1. How much did everything cost?", "answer": "The tea he bought was 6*0.25=€<<6*0.25=1>>1 more expensive per kg than what he normally buys\nSo it cost 6+1=€<<6+1=7>>7 per kg\nHe goes through 1*7=<<1*7=7>>7 kgs of tea a week\nSo he paid 7.5*7=€<<7.5*7=52>>52 on tea\nThat means his total bill was 52+1=€<<52+1=53>>53\n#### 53", "id_orig": 661, "id_shuffled": 42}
