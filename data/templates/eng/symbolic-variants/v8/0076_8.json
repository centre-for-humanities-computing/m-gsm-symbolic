{"question": "Carl caught 7 trouts last Wednesday, the first trout he caught weighs 76 kilograms, the second trout he caught weighs 32 kilograms, and the remaining trout he caught weighs 27 kilograms. If a kilogram of trout costs £2.5, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?", "answer": "Carl will earn 76*£2.5 = £<<76*2.5=190>>190 from the first trout.\nHe will earn 32*£2.5 = £<<32*2.5=80>>80 for the second trout.\nThe rest of the trouts are 7-2 = <<7-2=5>>5. He will earn 27*£2.5 = £<<27*2.5=67.5>>67.5 per each of them. So he will earn 5 * 67.5 = <<5*67.5>>=337.5\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the trouts is £190 + £80 + £337.5= £<<190+80+337.5=607>>607.\n#### 607", "id_orig": 1207, "id_shuffled": 76}
