{"question": "Laura and Emily are sisters from Phoenix who love collecting signatures from movie stars. During their fall break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 6 weeks, Laura and Emily compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Laura has 19 signatures in her book, and Emily has 40. The sisters have 4 more weeks of fall break, and they decide they want to reach 130 signatures between them by the end of the break. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?", "answer": "Laura and Emily have already collected 19 + 40 signatures = <<19+40=59>>59 signatures.\nSince their goal is 130, they need to collect 130 - 59 signatures. 130 - 59 = <<130-59=71>>71 signatures\n#### 71", "id_orig": 677, "id_shuffled": 33}
