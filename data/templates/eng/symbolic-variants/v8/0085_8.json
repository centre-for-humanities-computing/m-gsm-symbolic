{"question": "If Isabella and Andrea have 240 meters of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Andrea getting 190 meters more than Isabella, how much is left over for Isabella?", "answer": "Let x be the amount of fence Isabella gets and y be the amount Andrea gets. We know that y = x + 190, and y + x = 240.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+190=240\nSubtracting the 190 from both sides, we get 2x=50\nWe divide each side by two, leaving x=25. This means Isabella has 25 meters of fence left over.\n#### 25", "id_orig": 1084, "id_shuffled": 85}
