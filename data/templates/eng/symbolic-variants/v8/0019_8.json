{"question": "In a 110-item quiz, 20% of the questions are biology, and the rest are equally divided as algebra and literature questions. If Sophia is sure to get 95% of the biology questions, and half of the algebra and literature questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?", "answer": "The algebra and literature questions comprises 100% - 20% = 80% of the quiz.\nThere are 110 questions*20/100 = <<110*20/100=22>>22 biology questions.\nThere are a total of 110 questions*80/100 = <<110*80/100=88>>88 algebra and literature questions.\nIf Sophia is sure to get 95% of the biology questions, then this means she is sure of her 22 questions*95/100 = <<22*95/100=20>>20 points.\nFrom the algebra and literature questions, she is sure to get half of it correctly so that is 88 questions*1/2 = <<88*1/2=44>>44 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 20 points + 44 points = <<20+44=64>>64 points in her quiz.\n#### 64", "id_orig": 1021, "id_shuffled": 19}
