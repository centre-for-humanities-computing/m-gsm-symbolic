{"question": "To make a call from a hotel room phone, you must pay €0.75 for each minute of your call. After 33 minutes, that price drops to €0.25 per minute. How much would a 93-minute call cost?", "answer": "First 33 minutes would be a cost of 33 * 0.75 = €<<33*0.75=24>>24.\nAfter that, there are 93 - 33 = <<93-33=60>>60 minutes of the call left.\nAnd these 60 minutes cost 60 * 0.25 = €<<60*0.25=15>>15.\nSo in total, the 93-minute call would cost 24 + 15 = €39.\n#### 39", "id_orig": 1223, "id_shuffled": 10}
