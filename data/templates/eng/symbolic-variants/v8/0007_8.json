{"question": "A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys a variety of apples, wheats, cucumbers and oats. Since oats are a rare treat, he only buys four 3-oz boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the cows while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys six 8-oz bags. Apples are the main diet of his cows, so he buys thirty-six 75-oz packs. Wheats are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys nineteen 60-oz sacks. If his farm truck can carry 1950 ozs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?", "answer": "The farmer is buying 4*3 = <<4*3=12>>12 ozs of oats.\nHe is buying 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 ozs of cucumbers.\nHe is buying 19*60 = <<19*60=1140>>1140 ozs of wheats.\nHe is buying 36*75 = <<36*75=2700>>2700 ozs of apples.\nThe weight of all the feed is 12 + 48 + 1140 + 2700 = <<12+48+1140+2700=3900>>3900 ozs.\nThus, the farmer needs 3900 / 1950 = <<3900/1950=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2", "id_orig": 459, "id_shuffled": 7}
