{"question": "Oliver is feeding his livestock feed. Each llama needs 12 pounds, and each cow needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each llama needs. If there are 23 llamas and 29 cows, how many pounds of feed does Oliver need?", "answer": "First figure out how much feed each cow needs: 12 pounds * 2 - 3 = <<12*2-3=21>>21 pounds/cow\nNow figure out how much feed total the cows need: 21 pounds/cow * 29 cows = <<21*29=609>>609 pounds\nNow figure out how much feed total the llamas need: 12 pounds/llama * 23 llamas = <<12*23=276>>276 pounds\nNow add the two amounts of feed to find the total: 609 pounds + 276 pounds = <<609+276=885>>885 pounds\n#### 885", "id_orig": 937, "id_shuffled": 71}
