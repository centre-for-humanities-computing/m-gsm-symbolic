{"question": "In Mrs. Garcia's class of 29 students, 48% of the class are soccer players. Out of the remaining class, 32% of the students are dancers or part of choir members. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. How many students are leaving early?", "answer": "48% of the 29 student class are soccer players so that's 0.48*29 = <<0.48*29=13>>13 students\nThere are 29 students and 13 are soccer players so that leaves 29-13 = <<29-13=16>>16 students\n32% of the remaining 16 students are part of choir members or dancers so that's 0.32*16 = <<0.32*16=5>>5 students\n13 students are soccer players and 5 are part of choir members/dancers so 13+5 = <<13+5=19>>19 students will be leaving early\n#### 19", "id_orig": 982, "id_shuffled": 25}
