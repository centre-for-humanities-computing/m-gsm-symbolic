{"question": "Jessica buys 19 shares of a stock for $64 each. The stock price increases 80% the first year Jessica holds it, then decreases 25% in the second year. What is the final value of all Jessica's shares?", "answer": "First find the initial total value of Jessica's purchase: 19 shares * $64/share = $<<19*64=1216>>1216\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: $1216 * 0.8 = $<<1216*0.8=972.8>>972\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: $1216 + $972.8 = $<<1216+972.8=2188.8>>2188\nThen multiply that amount by 25% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: $2188.8 * 25% = $<<2188.8*25*.01=547.2>>547\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: $2188 - $547 = $<<2188-547=1641>>1641\n#### 1641", "id_orig": 336, "id_shuffled": 84}
