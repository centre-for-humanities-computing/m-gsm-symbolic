{"question": "Ms. Johnson is looking for a apartment that will not go beyond her $400,000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $390,000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 4% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 14% of the selling price. How much more is the total price of the apartment than Ms. Johnson's budget?", "answer": "The brokerage fee is $390,000*4/100 = $<<390,000*4/100=15,600>>15,600.\nThe transfer fee is $390,000*14/100 = $<<390,000*14/100=54,600>>54,600.\nThe total price of the apartment is $390,000 + $15,600 + $54,600 = $460,200.\nSo, it is $460,200 - $400,000 = $<<460,200-400,000=60,200>>60,200 more than Ms. Johnson's budget.\n#### 60,200", "id_orig": 265, "id_shuffled": 32}
