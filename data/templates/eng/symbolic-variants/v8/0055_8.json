{"question": "Emily is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the arabic abjad (with 28 letters) until she knows it. She writes it in full thrice, writes three quarters of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Emily written in total?", "answer": "Emily has written the arabic abjad (with 28 letters) thrice which is a total of 28*3=<<28*3=84>>84 letters.\nShe then writes three quarters the arabic abjad (with 28 letters), which is 28*3/4=<<28*3/4=21>>21 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 84 + 21 = <<84+21=105>>105 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 105 * 2 = <<105*2=210>>210 letters.\n#### 210", "id_orig": 546, "id_shuffled": 55}
