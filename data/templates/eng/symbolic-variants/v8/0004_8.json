{"question": "Kenneth is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 40 pop in the first 22 seconds of cooking, then two times that amount in the next 22 seconds. The kernels increase to five times the initial popping rate in the next 22 seconds, but in the final 22 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 22 seconds. After Kenneth takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Kenneth have to eat?", "answer": "In the second 22 seconds of cooking, 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80 kernels pop.\nIn the third 22 seconds, 5*40=<<5*40=200>>200 kernels pop.\nIn the final 22 seconds, 200 / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100 kernels pop.\nAfter cooking, the residual heat makes 100 / 4 = <<100/4=25>>25 kernels pop.\nThus, Kenneth has 40 + 80 + 200 + 100 + 25 = <<40+80+200+100+25=445>>445 pieces of popcorn to eat.\n#### 445", "id_orig": 1264, "id_shuffled": 4}
