{"question": "A medical center has a capacity of 1500 wards with 1/12 occupied. Due to the major accident, 45 patients are admitted into the medical center each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied wards in the medical center after 3 weeks.", "answer": "If 1/12 of the total capacity of the medical center wards is occupied, it means 1/12 * 1500 = <<1500*1/12=125>>125 wards have patients using them.\nThe total number of wards in the medical center without new admissions is 1500 wards - 125 wards = <<1500-125=1375>>1375 wards.\nIf 45 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the medical center after one week is 45 patients/day * 7 days/week = 315 patients.\nAfter 3 weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the medical center is 315 patients/week * 3 weeks = <<315*3=945>>945 patients, who each use one ward.\nIf there were 1375 unoccupied wards in the medical center before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 1375 wards - 945 wards = <<1375-945=430>>430 unoccupied wards.\n#### 430", "id_orig": 955, "id_shuffled": 28}
