{"question": "Noah collects garbage from 6 different apartment complexes. The first five have 400 apartments each and the last one is 45% bigger than the other five combined. He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid €0.25 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?", "answer": "The first five complexes have 5*400=<<5*400=2000>>2000 apartments\nNumber 6 has 2000*0.45=<<2000*0.45=900>>900 more apartments than those five combined.\nSo in total, it has 2000+900=<<2000+900=2900>>2900 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 2900+2000=<<2900+2000=4900>>4900 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 4900*3=<<4900*3=14,700>>14,700 apartments every week\nSo he makes 14,700*€0.25=€<<14,700*0.25=3675>>3675 every week\n#### 3675", "id_orig": 1165, "id_shuffled": 49}
