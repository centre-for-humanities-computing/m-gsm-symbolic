{"question": "Alex has a bag of buttons with 68 inside. He tripped over a toy while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 10. When he went back home, he inspected the buttons further. Nine of the ones he picked up weren't buttons, but actually beads so he got rid of them. How many buttons did Alex end up with?", "answer": "Alex dropped his buttons and was left with 68*1/2=<<68*1/2=34>>34 buttons.\nHe searched and found some of his lost buttons, getting him back to 34+10=<<34+10=44>>44 buttons.\nHe went home and removed nine beads, leaving him with 44-9=<<44-9=35>>35 buttons.\n#### 35", "id_orig": 1247, "id_shuffled": 61}
