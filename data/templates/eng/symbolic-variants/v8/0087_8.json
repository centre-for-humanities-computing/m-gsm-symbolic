{"question": "The biggest waterslide at Splash World is 260 meters long, and people slide down at 55 meters/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 210 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 75 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "answer": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 260 meters / 55 meters/minute = <<260/55=4>>4 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 210 meters / 75 meters/minute = <<210/75=2>>2 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 4 minutes - 2 minutes = <<4-2=2>>2 minutes\n#### 2", "id_orig": 1099, "id_shuffled": 87}
