{"question": "Comet Halley orbits the sun every 65 years. Lucas's father saw the Comet when he was 42 years old. Lucas saw the comet a second time when he was two times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Lucas when he saw the Comet for the first time?", "answer": "Lucas saw the Comet for the second time when he was 42 years * 2= <<42*2=84>>84 years old.\nComet Halley can be seen every 65 years, so Lucas saw the comet for the first time when he was 84 years - 65 years = <<84-65=19>>19 years old.\n#### 19", "id_orig": 991, "id_shuffled": 73}
