{"question": "Ethan watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched a 4-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show. On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 2-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 2-hour episodes. If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?", "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Thursday.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 24 - 4 = <<24-4=20>>20 hours of TV left.\nAfter Wednesday, he had 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 16 - 2 - 0.75 = 13.25 hours of TV left.\nAfter Saturday, he had 13.25 - 8 = 5.25 hours of TV left.\nEach 45-minute episode is 3/4 hour.\nThus, E = 5.25/0.75 = 7 episodes.\n#### 7", "id_orig": 107, "id_shuffled": 21}
