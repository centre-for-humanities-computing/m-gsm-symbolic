{"question": "The vending machines sell popcorn for 40 cents and crackers for 50 cents. Chris spent $12 and got 6 bags of popcorn and had 5% of his money left in change. How many crackers did he buy?", "answer": "Chris got $0.6 in change because $12*5/100 = <<12*5/100=0.6>>0.6\nChris spent $11.4 because 12 - 0.6 = <<12-0.6=11.4>>11.4\nChris spent $2.4 on popcorn because 6*0.4 = <<6*0.4=2.4>>2.4\nChris spent 9 on crackers because 11.4 - 2.4 = <<11.4-2.4=9>>9\nChris bought 18 crackers because 9 / 0.5 = <<18=18>>18\n#### 18", "id_orig": 434, "id_shuffled": 80}
