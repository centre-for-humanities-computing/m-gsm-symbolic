{"question": "Sophie's uncle said that she had £210 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have £3 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster twice. A round of mini-golf is £9. The roller coaster cost £9 a ride. How many friends can she invite?", "answer": "The roller coaster will cost £18 per person because 9*2 = <<9*2=18>>18\nEach person costs £30 because 3 + 9 + 18 = <<3+9+18=30>>30\n7 total people can attend because 210 / 30 = <<210/30=7>>7\nShe can invite 6 friends because 7 - 1 =<<7-1=6>>6\n#### 6", "id_orig": 357, "id_shuffled": 96}
