{"question": "Sophie qualified for a spot on the soccer team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a jersey for £12, a pair of soccer leggings for £11 more than the jersey cost, and a pair of athletic shoes that were originally £52 but were on sale for three quarters price. She had a coupon for £1 off the package of £11 athletic wristbands that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?", "answer": "The leggings were £11 more than the jersey, so they cost £11 + £12 = £<<11+12=23>>23.\nHer athletic shoes were three quarters the original £52 price, so they cost £52*3/4=£39.\nWith her coupon, the wristbands were £11 - £1 = £<<11-1=10>>10.\nThe jersey, leggings, athletic shoes, and wristbands together cost £12 + £23 + £39 + £10 = £<<12+23+39+10=84>>84.\n#### 84", "id_orig": 1053, "id_shuffled": 86}
