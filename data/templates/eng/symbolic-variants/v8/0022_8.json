Later, her husband also bought a package of 13 new plates and gave them to Ava. While Ava was making the roast chicken, she used eight of the plates to sample her roast chicken. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 34 plates. How many plates were in the package that Ava bought?", "answer": "The total number of plates from Ava and her husband was 34+8=<<34+8=42>>42 plates.\nSince the husband bought a package of 13 plates, then Ava's package contained 42-13=<<42-13=29>>29 plates.\n#### 29", "id_orig": 125, "id_shuffled": 22}
