{"question": "Ashley is an avid gardener. Last night, she received 31 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 5 potted plants on each of the 58 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 3 of the potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Ashley remain with?", "answer": "Last night, before receiving the plants, Ashley had 5*58 = <<5*58=290>>290 potted plants\nAfter receiving an additional 31 plants, she therefore had a total of 290 + 31 = <<290+31=321>>321 potted plants\nTomorrow, Ashleys plant giveaway will be 58*3 = <<58*3=174>>174 potted plants.\nShe will therefore remain with 321 - 174 = <<321-174=147>>147 potted plants.\n#### 147", "id_orig": 99, "id_shuffled": 13}
