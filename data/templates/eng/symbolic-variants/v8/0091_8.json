{"question": "At David's house, there are four times as many bananas as persimmons. He has a total of 20 persimmons in his house. David bought 75 more persimmons at the store and 31 fewer bananas than the number of persimmons. Find the combined total of the number of bananas and persimmons David has in the house?", "answer": "Before buying any banana and persimmon, David had four times as many bananas as persimmons, which is 20 persimmons*4 banana/persimmon = <<20*4=80>>80 bananas\nThe total number of bananas and persimmons that David had before is 80 bananas + 20 persimmons = <<80+20=100>>100 items\nWhen he bought 31 fewer bananas than persimmons, he bought 75 bananas - 31 bananas = <<75-31=44>>44 bananas\nIn total, he bought 44 bananas + 75 persimmons = <<44+75=119>>119 items\nAfter the purchases, David has 100 items + 119 items = <<100+119=219>>219 total bananas and persimmons combined.\n#### 219", "id_orig": 406, "id_shuffled": 91}
