{"question": "Emma is knitting winter wear for her 5 grandchildren. They're quintuplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a sweater, tunic, poncho, booties, and socks for each of them. It takes 16 skeins of wool to make a sweater, 14 for a tunic, 7 for a poncho, 18 for a pair of booties, and 3 for a pair of socks. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?", "answer": "A full outfit for each child will require 16 skeins per sweater + 14 skeins per tunic + 7 skeins per poncho + 18 skeins per pair of booties + 3 skeins per pair of socks = <<16+14+7+18+3=58>>58 skeins of wool.\nSo to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 5*58 = <<5*58=290>>290 skeins of wool.\n#### 290", "id_orig": 520, "id_shuffled": 23}
