How much did Henry spend on everything?", "answer": "Henry spent 16*$7.25 = $<<16*7.25=116>>116 for the notebooks.\nHe also spent 8*$8.75 = $<<8*8.75=70>>70 for the folders.\nTherefore, Henry spent a total of $116 + $70 + $17 = $<<116+70+17=203>>203 for the school supplies.\n#### 203", "id_orig": 158, "id_shuffled": 18}
