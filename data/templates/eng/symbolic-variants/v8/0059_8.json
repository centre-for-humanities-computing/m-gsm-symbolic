{"question": "I have 14 liters of apple drink that are half water and I wish to add it to 30 liters of lemon drink that is two thirds water. But as I pour it, I spill two liters of the apple drink. How much water is in the remaining 42 liters?", "answer": "There are 30*2/3 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 liters of water from the 30 liters lemon drink.\nAfter two liters of apple drink was spilled, there were 14-2 = <<14-2=12>>12 liters of apple drink left.\nOut of the 12 liters, 12*1/2 = <<12*1/2=6>>6 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 20 + 6 = <<20+6=26>>26 liters of water out of the 42 liters.\n#### 26", "id_orig": 20, "id_shuffled": 59}
