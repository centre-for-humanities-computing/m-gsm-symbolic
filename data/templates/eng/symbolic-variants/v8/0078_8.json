{"question": "There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but Michael has to take 3 extra classes. Each class is 45 minutes long. He goes to class for 6 days a week. He then spends 1/2 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?", "answer": "He takes 6+3=<<6+3=9>>9 classes a day\nThat means he spends 45*9=<<45*9=405>>405 minutes per day in class\nSo he spends 405*6=<<405*6=2430>>2430 minutes a week\nThat means he spends 2430*1/2=<<2430*1/2=1215>>1215 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.\nSo he spends 2430+1215+1215=<<2430+1215+1215=4860>>4860 minutes per week\nSo he spends 4860/60=<<4860/60=81>>81 hours per week\n#### 81", "id_orig": 1088, "id_shuffled": 78}
