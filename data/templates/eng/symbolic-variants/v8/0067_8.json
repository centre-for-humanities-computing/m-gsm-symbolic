{"question": "Matt's SUV breaks down. The SUV weighs 1750 kilograms and he has luggage in it weighing 225 kilograms. He also has his four young teammates who weigh 95 kilograms each in it. If the force to move the SUV is 5% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the SUV?", "answer": "His four teammates weigh 95*4=<<95*4=380>>380 kilograms\nSo the total weight of the SUV and everything is 1750+225+380=<<1750+225+380=2355>>2355 kilograms\nSo he needs to generate 2355*0.05=<<2355*0.05=117>>117 kilograms\n#### 117", "id_orig": 1275, "id_shuffled": 67}
