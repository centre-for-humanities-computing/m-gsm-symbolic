{"question": "Michael wants to make different sized ice cubes with 100 ozs of water. He can make giant cubes that use 8 ozs per cube, medium cubes that use 6 ozs, and small cubes that use 1/5 oz. If he makes 3 giant cubes, 10 medium cubes, and 15 small cubes, how many ozs of water does he have left?", "answer": "The giant cubes used up 24 ozs of water because 3 times 8 equals <<3*8=24>>24.\nThe medium cubes used up 60 ozs of water because 10 times 6 equals <<10*6=60>>60.\nThe small cubes used up 3 ozs of water because 15 times 1/5 equals 3.\nThis means that Michael has used up 87 ozs of water because 24 plus 60 plus 3 equals 87.\nMichael has 13 ozs of water left because 100 minus 87 equals <<100-87=13>>13.\n#### 13", "id_orig": 737, "id_shuffled": 11}
