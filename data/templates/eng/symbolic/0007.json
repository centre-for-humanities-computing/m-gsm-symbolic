  "question": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay are the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound packs. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?",
  "answer": "The farmer is buying 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.\nHe is buying 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 pounds of carrots.\nHe is buying 20*65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 pounds of oats.\nHe is buying 42*75 = <<42*75=3150>>3150 pounds of hay.\nThe weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 1300 + 3150 = <<2+48+1300+3150=4500>>4500 pounds.\nThus, the farmer needs 4500 / 2250 = <<4500/2250=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.\n#### 2",
