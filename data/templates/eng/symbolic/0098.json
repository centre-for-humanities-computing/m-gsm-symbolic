  "question": "A plague infects ten people. Every day, each infected person infects six others. How many people are infected after three days?",
  "answer": "On the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10*6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.\nThere are 10+60 = <<10+60=70>>70 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 70*6 = <<70*6=420>>420 more people are infected.\nThere are 70 + 420 = <<70+420=490>>490 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 490*6 = 2940 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 490 + 2940 = 3430 infected people after three days.\n#### 3430",
