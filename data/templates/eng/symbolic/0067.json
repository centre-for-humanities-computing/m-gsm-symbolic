  "question": "John's car breaks down. The car weighs 1200 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 250 pounds. He also has his two young children who weigh 75 pounds each in it. If the force to move the car is 1% of the weight, how much force does he need to push the car?",
  "answer": "His two children weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 pounds\nSo the total weight of the car and everything is 1200+250+150=<<1200+250+150=1600>>1600 pounds\nSo he needs to generate 1600*0.01=<<1600*0.01=16>>16 pounds\n#### 16",
