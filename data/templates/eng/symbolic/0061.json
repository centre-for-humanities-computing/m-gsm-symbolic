  "question": "Brendan has a bag of marbles with 10 inside. He tripped over a pebble while carrying it and dropped half of them. He scrambled to search for them but only came up with 3. When he went back home, he inspected the marbles further. Two of the ones he picked up weren't marbles, but actually beads so he got rid of them. How many marbles did Brendan end up with?",
  "answer": "Brendan dropped his marbles and was left with 10*1/2=<<10*1/2=5>>5 marbles.\nHe searched and found some of his lost marbles, getting him back to 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 marbles.\nHe went home and removed two beads, leaving him with 8-2=<<8-2=6>>6 marbles.\n#### 6",
