  "question": "I have 10 liters of orange drink that are two thirds water and I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill four liters of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 21 liters?",
  "answer": "There are 15*3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.\nAfter four liters of orange drink was spilled, there were 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 liters of orange drink left.\nOut of the 6 liters, 6*2/3 = <<6*2/3=4>>4 liters are water.\nThus, there are a total of 9 + 4 = <<9+4=13>>13 liters of water out of the 21 liters.\n#### 13",
