  "question": "Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his mighty sword, while Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Using a rusty iron axe, Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. But Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file. How many dragons has Prince Bruce slain?",
  "answer": "Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, or 100*3/4=<<100*3/4=75>>75 dragons.\nPrince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, or 2*75=<<2*75=150>>150 dragons.\nPrince Bruce slew one fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, or 150*1/5=<<150*1/5=30>>30 dragons.\n#### 30",
