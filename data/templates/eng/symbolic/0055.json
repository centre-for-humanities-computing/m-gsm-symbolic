  "answer": "Elise has written the alphabet twice which is a total of 26*2=<<26*2=52>>52 letters.\nShe then writes half the alphabet, which is 26*1/2=<<26*1/2=13>>13 letters.\nSo far, this is a total of 52 + 13 = <<52+13=65>>65 letters.\nWriting this again means she has doubled the number of letters she has written, so she has written a total of 65 * 2 = <<65*2=130>>130 letters.\n#### 130",
