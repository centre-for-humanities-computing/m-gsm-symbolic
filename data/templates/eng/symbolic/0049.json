  "question": "John collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes. The first two have 200 apartments each and the last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined. He collects garbage 3 times a week from each place and he gets paid $0.4 per collection for each apartment. How much money does he make in a week?",
  "answer": "The first two complexes have 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 apartments\nNumber 3 has 400*0.6=<<400*0.6=240>>240 more apartments than those two combined.\nSo in total, it has 400+240=<<400+240=640>>640 apartments.\nSo in total, he goes to 640+400=<<640+400=1040>>1040 apartments each time\nThat means he visits 1040*3=<<1040*3=3120>>3120 apartments every week\nSo he makes 3120*$0.4=$<<3120*0.4=1248>>1248 every week\n#### 1248",
