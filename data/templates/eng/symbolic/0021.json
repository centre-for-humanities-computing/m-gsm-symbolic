  "question": "Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?",
  "answer": "Let E be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.\nAfter Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.\nAfter Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.\nAfter Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 0.5 = 3.5 hours of TV left.\nAfter Friday, he had 3.5 - 2 = 1.5 hours of TV left.\nEach 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.\nThus, E = 1.5/0.5 = 3 episodes.\n#### 3",
