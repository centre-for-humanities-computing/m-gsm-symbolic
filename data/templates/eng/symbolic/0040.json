  "question": "Sally went to the seashore for vacation. Her parents gave her $15 to buy whatever she wanted. At the souvenir shop, taffy was on sale for \"Buy 1 pound at $3 per pound, get 1 pound 1/2 off.\" She scooped up 4 pounds. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.5 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each. How much money does Sally have left?",
  "answer": "Sally is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound 1/2 off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $3*1/2 = $1.5. The rest of 2 pounds does not have discount and costs 2*$3 = $6, so total is $3+$3/2+$6=$21/2\n4 magnets at $0.25 each is 4*0.25=$<<4*0.25=1>>1\nWhen you add all her purchases, $21/2+$1.5+$1 = $<<21/2+1.5+1=13>>13\nShe had $15 and spent $13 so she had $15-$13 = $<<15-13=2>>2 left over\n#### 2",
