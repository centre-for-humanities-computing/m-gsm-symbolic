  "question": "One gnome can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. He can mine twice as much with a bronze pickaxe and 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 40 gnomes with steel pickaxes mine in a month with 30 days?",
  "answer": "First find how much ore a gnome can mine with an bronze pickaxe: 12 pounds/day*2=<<12*2=24>>24 pounds/day\nThen multiply that amount by 150% to find how much a gnome can mine with a steel pickaxe: 24 pounds/day * 150% = <<24*150*.01=36>>36 pounds/day\nThen multiply the amount one gnome can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe by the number of gnomes: 36 pounds/day/gnome * 40 gnomes = <<36*40=1440>>1440 pounds/day\nThen multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = <<1440*30=43,200>>43,200 pounds/day\n#### 43,200",
