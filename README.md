We expect to get a performance table somewhat like:

\* We might decide not to train on gsm8k to keep it "held-out" and instead train on another available dataset and its translation.

Where degree of generalization is as follows:

1) Minimal generalization
2) Generalization to unseen samples, but similar distribution
3) Generalization to Danish but just translated, but similar distribution
4) Generalization to Danish as well as unseen samples, but similar distribution
5) Generalization to Danish, unseen samples and under a novel distribution

## Process

1) Initial translation with using chatgpt 4o (completed)
```
uv run scr/scripts/initial_translation.py
```

2) Manual correction and localization, this could for example include (partially completed)
    - fixing spelling errors
    - replacing names with natively plausible names
    - converting units to metrics

3) Generate samples (not completed)

- implement naive parser (for gsm8k, gsm-dan)
- implement symbolic variant parser (for *-variants)

4) Convert Kænguruen (partially completed)

- Converted 2024, 8-9th grade, 6-7 grade, and 4-5 grade
- Converted 2023, 8-9th grade, and 6-7 grade (note, for all grade levels: only includes "percentage correct")
- Converted 2022, 8-9th grade, and 6-7 grade (note, for all grade levels: only includes "percentage correct")
- Converted 2021, 8-9th grade (neither "solution description" nor "percentage correct"), and 6-7 grade (only including "percentage correct")
- Converted 2020, 8-9th grade (neither "solution description" nor "percentage correct"), and 6-7 grade (only including "percentage correct")

5) Build Training setup (partially completed)

Niklas has been working on it

6) Train Models (not/partially completed) 

7) Evaluation Setup (not completed)
